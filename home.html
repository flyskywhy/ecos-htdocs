<h3>eCos 1.3.1 release</h3>

<p>In the third major public release of eCos, we have added a wealth of
new features, enhancements, and have further extended the target platform
coverage.</p>

<p>The configuration system has been completely revised and updated. Major new
elements include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Package management that supports the extension of eCos functionality via
third party add-on packages
<li>A standardized configuration save file format that is human readable and
editable, and compatible between both GUI and command line configuration
tools.
<li>Enhanced web based help and component documentation system integrated into
the GUI configuration tool
<li>The Component Definition Language (CDL) has been radically revised and
has now been implemented as a TCL extension for maximum flexibility. CDL is
now fully documented in the <i>eCos Component Writer's Guide</i>.
<li>Template support for straightforward control of multiple configuration
elements, which can be used to provide easy access to standard eCos
configurations such as a debug stub boot ROM.
<li>Best of all, the source of the new configuration tools and underlying
libCDL technology has been open sourced under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU Public License</a> (GPL).
</ul>

<p>A companion beta version of the eCos TCP/IP stack has been released in
conjunction with 1.3.1. The stack is derived from the OpenBSD source base
and provides UDP, TCP, ICMP and BOOTP protocol support on an IPv4 standards
base. Device driver support for Cirrus Logic EP72xx evaluation boards and
Motorola MBX is included. The stack, ethernet core support, and device
drivers are all distributed as configurable eCos packages.</p>

<p>A PCI bus support library has also been added that provides generic PCI bus
based device initialization, discovery, and configuration. The library has
been ported to both the VR4300 DDB-VRC4373 and StrongARM EBSA285 development
boards.</p>

<p>New architectures and platforms added in this release include:

<ul>
<li>ARM Thumb
<li>ARM9
<li>Cirrus Logic CL-PS7111 and EP72xx
<li>Cogent CMA222 and CMA230 ARM boards
<li>Hitachi SH3
<li>Intel StrongARM
<li>Intel x86 PC
<li>Matsushita AM33
<li>Motorola MBX evaluation board
<li>NEC MIPS VR4300
</ul>

For further details of all the changes see the <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/ecos/packages/NEWS?content-type=text/plain&cvsroot=ecos">NEWS</a> file.</p>

<p>This is the first release of eCos since the merger of Red Hat and Cygnus
Solutions was completed. Red Hat is dedicated to continued enhancement and
maintenance of the eCos system. Developers can look forward to upcoming
releases that further expand the architectural and board coverage, extend
the functionality of the TCP/IP stack, add a Linux version of the GUI
configuration tool, and add major new features such as a Linux/Posix
compatibility layer based on the upcoming EL/IX standard - see the 
<a href="../elix/">EL/IX web site</a> for more details.</p>

<p>The merger has brought about some minor changes to eCos's Mozilla-derived
public license, the most fundamental of which is simply the change of name
from Cygnus eCos Public License (CEPL) to Red Hat eCos Public License
(RHEPL). The license terms themselves have not changed in any material way
other than alterations necessary to accommodate the change in company
details.</p>

<h2>About eCos</h2>

<p>eCos is provided as an open source runtime system supported by the Red Hat
GNUPro and GNU open source development tools. Developers have full and
unfettered access to all aspects of the runtime system. No parts of it are
proprietary or hidden, and you are at liberty to examine, add to, and modify
the code as you deem necessary. These rights are granted to you and
protected by the Red Hat eCos Public License (RHEPL). It also grants you the
right to freely develop and distribute applications based on eCos. You are
not expected or required to make your embedded applications or any
additional components that you develop freely available, although we do
require that you make publicly available any modifications to the eCos code
itself. Red Hat of course welcomes all contributions back to eCos such as
board ports, device drivers and other components, as this helps the growth
and development of eCos, and is of benefit to the entire eCos community.</p>

<p>One of the key technological innovations in eCos is our configuration
system. The configuration system allows the application writer to impose
their requirements on the run-time components, both in terms of their
functionality and implementation, whereas traditionally the operating system
has constrained the application's own implementation. Essentially, this
enables eCos developers to create their own application-specific operating
system and makes eCos suitable for a wide range of embedded uses.
Configuration also ensures that the resource footprint of eCos is minimized
as all unnecessary functionality and features are removed. The configuration
system also presents eCos as a component architecture. This provides a
standardized mechanism for component suppliers to extend the functionality
of eCos and allows applications to be built from a wide set of optional
configurable run-time components. Components can be provided from a variety
of sources including: the standard eCos release; commercial third party
developers; open source contributors; or additional optional components from
Red Hat.</p>

<p>The royalty-free nature of eCos means that you can develop and deploy your
application using the standard eCos release without incurring any royalty
charges. In addition, there are no up-front license charges for the eCos
runtime source code and associated tools. We provide, without charge,
everything necessary for basic embedded applications development.</p>

<p>eCos is designed to be portable to a wide range of target architectures and
target platforms including 16, 32, and 64 bit architectures, MPUs, MCUs and
DSPs. The eCos kernel, libraries and runtime components are layered on the
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), and thus will run on any target once the
HAL and relevant device drivers have been ported to the target's processor
architecture and board. Currently eCos supports seven different target
architectures (ARM, Hitachi SH3, Intel x86, MIPS, Matsushita AM3x, PowerPC
and SPARC) including many of the popular variants of these architectures and
evaluation boards. Many new ports are in development and will be released as
they become available.</p>

<p>eCos has been designed to support applications with real-time requirements,
providing features such as full preemptability, minimal interrupt latencies,
and all the necessary synchronization primitives, scheduling policies, and
interrupt handling mechanisms needed for these type of applications. eCos
also provides all the functionality required for general embedded
application support including device drivers, memory management, exception
handling, C, math libraries, etc. In addition to runtime support, the eCos
system includes all the tools necessary to develop embedded applications,
including eCos software configuration and build tools, and GNU based
compilers, assemblers, linkers, debuggers, and simulators.</p>

<p>The following core functionality is provided:</p>
<UL>
  <LI>Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)</LI>
  <LI>Real-time kernel</LI>
      <UL>
	<LI>Interrupt handling</LI>

  <LI>ISO C and math libraries
  <LI>Serial device drivers
  <LI>GDB debug support
</UL>


<h2>Supported hosts</h2>
<p>The eCos net distribution is available in both Linux
and Windows versions. The Linux version has been tested under <a
href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a> Linux 6.1 (and later releases) but should work
under most Linux variants. The Windows version has been tested under <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>&reg; Windows NT 4.0 and also
works under Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows 2000. However, please note that it is not possible to
build the eCos development tools under Windows 95 or Windows 98 at this time.</p>

<h2>Host software</h2>
<p>The system comes with full support for manual configuration of the
system on all host platforms. In addition Windows users get a
graphical configuration tool which simplifies the process of
configuring a system and validating the resulting system. This tool is
not yet available for Linux users. It has, however, been used successfully with
Windows NT 4.0 running as a guest operating system under
<A HREF="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware for Linux</A>.</p>

<p>The eCos net distribution is intended to be used in conjunction with GNU development
tools which are available freely on the net. As a minimum, the <i>gcc</i> compiler,
<i>gdb</i> debugger and <i>binutils</i> tools are required to build eCos, link with
application code and undertake debugging.</p>
