<h3>Introduction</h3>

The embedded Cygnus operating system (eCos) is an open-source,
configurable, portable, and royalty-free embedded RTOS. The system
comes with everything necessary to develop eCos based applications,
including tools, documentation and complete sources. All eCos runtime
source code is distributed under the Cygnus eCos Public License
(CEPL), a derivative of the Netscape Public License.
<P>
This release is a &quot;Technology Release&quot;. It provides all the
functionality needed for a wide variety of embedded applications, and
it has undergone extensive testing. However at this stage it is
only available for a limited number of target architectures, and there
is lots of additional functionality that can and will be added. We
have chosen to release the system at this stage because it can already
be of great benefit to many embedded system developers, and to
encourage the development of an eCos open source user community on the
net which will help to move the system forwards.

      simulator. This target should be considered a beta.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Supported Hosts</H3>
<P>
The main supported host is Windows NT on an x86-based host. The
system has also been tested on Red Hat 5.1 Linux using an x86-based
host, and on both Windows 95 and 98, but these hosts should also be
considered a beta. The system has not been tested on any other host
platform.
<P>
<H3>Host Software</H3>
<P>
The system comes with full support for manual configuration of the
system on all host platforms. In addition Windows users get a
graphical configuration tool which simplifies the process of
configuring a system and validating the resulting system. This tool is
not yet available for Linux users. It is likely that new host tools,
including future versions of the graphical configuration tool, will
only be available as part of the Developer Kit product.
<P>
The system comes with a full set of tools needed for embedded systems
development. This includes the compilers gcc and g++, the assembler
and linker, the debugger gdb, and simulators for all the target
architectures.
