This web site provides the latest information on eCos for the benefit of the sourceware developer community. eCos was first released to the general public on November 2nd, 1998. You will find sections introducing eCos and describing how to get started with this new embedded operating system. We plan to expand this site rapidly, providing detailed information of relevance to all eCos developers.<p>

We welcome your feedback. Please send comments to the webmaster &lt;<a href="mailto:sourcemaster@cygnus.com">sourcemaster@cygnus.com</a>&gt;.
