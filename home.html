<H3>Welcome</H3>

Cygnus has developed a complete 
<a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/">Sourceware</a> real time operating
system called <b>eCos</b>, the <i>Embedded Cygnus Operating System</i>.
eCos allows fine-grained configuration of the kernel and other components,
thus making it possible to write applications with a very small footprint.
eCos is also very portable and allows other operating systems to
be implemented with alternative configurations of the eCos kernel.
The current release includes a &micro;ITRON compatibility layer.

<p>The first full net release will occur on November 2nd, 1998 and will
include complete source code for multiple processor platforms, all kernel
components, HAL layers, &micro;ITRON API, C run-time, math libraries,
and drivers.
