<h1>Downloading and Installation</h1>
<HR noshade SIZE=3>

<p> These instructions describe how to download and install recent
versions of the eCos real-time operating system.
<!--
This version was released on 20th May, 2003 and has
remained frozen since then. If you wish to use a more recent version
of eCos please consider using <a href="anoncvs.html">Anonymous CVS</a>
to get the latest and greatest, however less well tested version of
eCos. Installing the host support tools as described here is
recommended when using anonymous CVS.
-->
</p>

<h2>Host support</h2>

<p>The eCos net distribution is available in both Linux
and Windows versions. The Linux version is tested under recent
versions of the Fedora, openSUSE and Ubuntu distributions for x86 and should work
under most Linux variants. The Windows version has been tested under
Windows 2000 Professional, Windows XP and Windows Vista. It should also work
under Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a. Please
note that eCos is no longer supported under Windows 95/98/ME.</p>

<h2>Downloading and installation instructions</h2>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>Developers wishing to use the pre-built eCos 3.0 host tools on a <i>Linux</i>
host must first ensure that they have libstdc++ v3 (<tt>/usr/lib/libstdc++.so.5</tt>)
installed. Users of Linux distributions which provide a more
recent libstdc++ may need to install a libstdc++ v3 compatibility package.
Installation of the compatibility package may be achieved as follows:</p>

<ul><table>
<tr><td>Fedora:</td>                        <td><tt>yum install compat-libstdc++-33</tt></td>
<tr><td>openSUSE:</td>                      <td><tt>zypper install libstdc++33</tt></td>
<tr><td>Ubuntu 9.10 (and later):</td>       <td><tt>dpkg -i <a href="http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/universe/g/gcc-3.3/libstdc++5_3.3.6-17ubuntu1_i386.deb">libstdc++5_3.3.6-17ubuntu1_i386.deb</a></tt></td>
<tr><td>Ubuntu 9.04 (and earlier):&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> <td><tt>apt-get install libstdc++5</tt></td>
</table></ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> Snapshot builds of the eCos host tools which use the more recent <tt>libstdc++.so.6</tt> shared library are <a href="/ml/ecos-discuss/2011-02/msg00031.html">now available</a>.</p>

<p>The Linux-hosted eCos Configuration Tool also requires the GTK+ toolkit
version 2.0 or later.</p>

<h3>Cygwin</h3>

<p>Developers wishing to install eCos on a <i>Windows</i> host must first install a recent
version of the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> UNIX emulation system.
Full instructions on <a href="cygwin.html">installing Cygwin for
use with eCos</a> are available. The following instructions assume that Cygwin has
already been installed (where necessary) and that the reader is familiar with invoking a
<i>bash</i> shell.</p>

<h3>eCos and Toolchain</h3>

<p>The most recent eCos release (eCos 3.0) may be installed using an installation tool which simplifies
the downloading and installation of the eCos sources, host tools and documentation.
The installation tool can optionally download one or more pre-built GNU cross toolchains
(contributed by <a href="http://www.ecoscentric.com/">eCosCentric Limited</a>)
for use in conjunction with eCos. At present, toolchains for the following target
architectures are available for download in pre-built form:</p>

<center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=7>
<tr bgcolor=#999999><td><b>Architecture</b></td><td><b>Target</b></td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=#dddddd><td>ARM (ARM7TDMI, ARM9, Cortex-M, XScale)</td><td><tt>arm-eabi</tt></td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=#dddddd><td>ARM (ARM7DI, StrongARM)</td><td><tt>arm-elf</tt></td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=#dddddd><td>ColdFire</td><td><tt>m68k-elf</tt></td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=#dddddd><td>Intel x86</td><td><tt>i386-elf</tt></td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=#dddddd><td>MIPS32</td><td><tt>mipsisa32-elf</tt></td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=#dddddd><td>PowerPC</td><td><tt>powerpc-eabi</tt></td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=#dddddd><td>SuperH</td><td><tt>sh-elf</tt></td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>Developers targetting one of the other architectures must build a toolchain
themselves at present. Full instructions for downloading source code and
<a href="build-toolchain.html">building a toolchain</a> are available.</p>

<p>We recommend that eCos is installed to <tt>/opt/ecos</tt> where it will be
accessible by all users. This may require installation by a user with suitable
privileges. First, download the eCos installation tool by using the following
command at a <i>bash</i> prompt:</p>

<ul><tt>
<nobr>wget --passive-ftp ftp://ecos.sourceware.org/pub/ecos/ecos-install.tcl</nobr>
</tt></ul>

<p>The installation tool may then be invoked as follows:</p>

<ul><tt>
<nobr>sh ecos-install.tcl</nobr>
</tt></ul>

<p>The installation tool will present a list of mirror sites
from which the software may be downloaded. For best results, please select a
mirror site in your own geographical region. The tool will then prompt for an
installation location. Finally, the tool will present a list
of pre-built GNU toolchains available for download. Select each toolchain you wish
to download by entering the corresponding number. When all required toolchains have
been selected, enter <tt>q</tt>. Downloading and installation of the software will
then commence.</p>

<p>Windows users should note that POSIX-style paths are relative to the root of their
Cygwin installation (typically <tt>c:\cygwin</tt>) by default. For example,
<tt>/opt/ecos</tt> might be located at <tt>c:\cygwin\opt\ecos</tt> in the Windows Explorer.</p>

<p>Users may wish to create a shortcut to the eCos Configuration Tool on their desktop. Typically,
this may be achieved by dragging the <tt>configtool</tt> or <tt>configtool.exe</tt> executable file
from the file manager provided by your operating system onto the desktop and dropping it while
holding down the shift and ctrl keys. This file is located
in the <tt>ecos-<i>version</i>/tools/bin</tt> directory under the location at which eCos was installed.
On Windows hosts, it will be necessary to modify the "Start in" property of the shortcut to specify the Cygwin
<tt>/bin</tt> directory (typically <tt>c:\cygwin\bin</tt>) as the working directory.</p>

<p>Users who have downloaded eCos previously and now wish to download additional
toolchains should re-invoke the eCos installer, specifying the <tt>-t</tt> switch
on the installer command line as follows:</p>

<ul><tt>
<nobr>sh ecos-install.tcl -t</nobr>
</tt></ul>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Full documentation is available <a href="docs.html">online</a>.
It is included within the eCos net distribution in HTML format only.
<!-- The
documentation may also be downloaded separately in multiple archive formats:

<ul>
<li><a href="ftp://ecos.sourceware.org/pub/ecos/releases/ecos-3.0b1/eCosDoc30beta1.zip">eCos 3.0 beta 1 documentation</A> (eCosDoc30b1.zip - ???MB)
<li><a href="ftp://ecos.sourceware.org/pub/ecos/releases/ecos-3.0b1/ecos-3.0beta1-doc.tar.bz2">eCos 3.0 beta 1 documentation</a> (ecos-3.0b1-doc.tar.bz2 -  ???MB)
</ul>-->
</p>

<p>New users are encouraged to follow the programming
tutorial in the appropriate <i>Getting Started with eCos</i> document
which guides the reader through the stages involved in
building and running an eCos application.</p>

<h2>Previous releases</h2>

<p>Downloading and installation of the latest version of eCos using the eCos installer
described above is recommended.
However, current and previous public <a href="ftp://ecos.sourceware.org/pub/ecos/README">releases</a> of eCos and
the pre-built toolchains are also available for downloading directly via one of the eCos
<a href="mirror.html">mirror sites</a>.
Users of eCos 1.3.1 may refer to the eCos 1.3.1 installation instructions for
<a href="install-linux-131.html">Linux</a> and <a href="install-windows-131.html">Windows</a>.</p>
