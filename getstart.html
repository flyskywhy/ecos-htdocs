<h1>Downloading and Installation</h1>
<HR noshade SIZE=3>

<h2>Host support</h2>

<p>The eCos net distribution is available in both Linux
and Windows versions. The Linux version is tested under recent
versions of the Red Hat, SuSE and Debian distributions for x86 and should work
under most Linux variants. The Windows version has been tested under
Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional and should also work under Windows 95, Windows 98,
Windows ME and Windows XP. However, building the eCos
GNU cross toolchains under Windows 95/98/ME has been found to be
unreliable. We recommend that users avoid building the development tools on
these systems if possible.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Cygwin</h3>

<p>Developers wishing to install eCos on a <i>Windows</i> host must first install a recent
version of the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> UNIX emulation system.
Full instructions on <a href="cygwin.html">installing Cygwin for
use with eCos</a> are available. The following instructions assume that Cygwin has
already been installed (where necessary) and that the reader is familiar with invoking a
<i>bash</i> shell.</p>

<h3>Toolchain</h3>

<p>The eCos 2.0 beta release features an installation tool which simplifies the downloading
and installation of the eCos sources, host tools and documentation.
The installation tool can optionally download one or more pre-built GNU cross toolchains
(contributed by <a href="http://www.ecoscentric.com/">eCosCentric Limited</a>)
for use in conjunction with eCos. At present, toolchains for the following target
architectures are available in pre-built form:</p>

<center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=7>
<tr bgcolor=#999999><td><b>Architecture</b></td><td><b><tt>TARGET</tt></b></td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=#dddddd><td>ARM (including StrongARM, XScale)</td><td><tt>arm-elf</tt></td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=#dddddd><td>Hitachi SuperH</td><td><tt>sh-elf</tt></td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=#dddddd><td>Intel x86</td><td><tt>i386-elf</tt></td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=#dddddd><td>MIPS32</td><td><tt>mipsisa32-elf</tt></td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=#dddddd><td>PowerPC</td><td><tt>powerpc-eabi</tt></td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>Developers targetting one of the other architectures must build a toolchain
themselves at present. Full instructions for downloading source code and
<a href="build-toolchain.html">building a toolchain</a> are available.</p>

<h3>eCos</h3>

<p>We recommend that eCos is installed to <tt>/opt/ecos</tt> where it will be
accessible by all users. This may require installation by a user with suitable
privileges. First, download the eCos installation tool by using the following
command at a <i>bash</i> prompt:</p>

<ul><tt>
<nobr>wget --passive-ftp ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/ecos-install.tcl</nobr>
</tt></ul>

<p>The installation tool may then be invoked by using a command of the form:</p>

<ul><tt>
<nobr>sh ecos-install.tcl INSTALLPATH [ TARGET ... ]</nobr>
</tt></ul>

<p>For example, to download and install eCos with both the ARM and Intel x86
pre-built toolchains to the <tt>/opt/ecos</tt> directory, use the following command:</p>

<ul><tt>
<nobr>sh ecos-install.tcl /opt/ecos arm-elf i386-elf</nobr>
</tt></ul>

<p>The installation tool will present a list of <a href="mirror.html">mirror sites</a> from which eCos may be downloaded.
For best results, please select a mirror site in your own geographical region.</p>

<p>Windows users should note that POSIX-style paths are relative to the root of their
Cygwin installation (typically <tt>c:\cygwin</tt>) by default. For example,
<tt>/opt/ecos</tt> might be located at <tt>c:\cygwin\opt\ecos</tt> in the Windows Explorer.</p>

<p>Following installation, individual users of eCos should extract the default platform information which
the eCos Configuration Tool uses to run tests. For Windows users, this can be achieved by
double-clicking on the <tt>platforms.reg</tt> file in the Windows Explorer. This file may be
found in the <tt>ecos-2.0b1/tools/bin</tt> directory under the location at which eCos was installed.
Linux users, should execute the following command from the location at which eCos was installed:</p>

<ul><tt>
<nobr>tar -C $HOME -xf ecos-2.0b1/tools/bin/platforms.tar</nobr>
</tt></ul>

<p>Users may also wish to create a shortcut to the eCos Configuration Tool on their desktop. Typically,
this may be achieved by dragging the <tt>configtool</tt> or <tt>configtool.exe</tt> executable file
from the file manager provided by your operating system onto the desktop. This file is located
in the <tt>ecos-2.0b1/tools/bin</tt> directory under the location at which eCos was installed.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Full documentation is available <a href="docs.html">online</a> in both HTML and PDF formats.
It is included within the eCos net distribution in HTML format only. The HTML
documentation may also be downloaded separately in multiple archive formats:

<ul>
<li><a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/releases/ecos-2.0b1/eCosDoc20b1.zip">eCos 2.0 beta documentation</A> (eCosDoc20b1.zip - 2.9MB)
<li><a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/releases/ecos-2.0b1/ecos-2.0b1-doc.tar.bz2">eCos 2.0 beta documentation</a> (ecos-2.0b1-doc.tar.bz2 - 1.8MB)
</ul></p>

<p>New users are encouraged to follow the programming
tutorial in the appropriate <i>Getting Started with eCos</i> document
which guides the reader through the stages involved in
building and running an eCos application.</p>

<h2>Previous releases</h2>

<p>Previous public releases of eCos remain available for <a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/README">downloading</a>. Users of eCos 1.3.1 may refer to the eCos 1.3.1
installation instructions for <a href="install-linux-131.html">Linux</a> and <a href="install-windows-131.html">Windows</a>.</p>
