<h3>Host support</h3>

The eCos net distribution is available in both Linux
and Windows versions. The Linux version has been tested under <a
href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a> Linux 6.1 (and later releases) but should work
under most Linux variants. The Windows version has been tested under <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> Windows NT 4.0 and also
works under Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows 2000. However, please note that it is not possible to
build the eCos development tools under Windows 95 or Windows 98 at this time.
