<h1>Downloading and Installation</h1>
<HR noshade SIZE=3>

<h2>Host support</h2>

<p>The eCos net distribution is available in both Linux
and Windows versions. The Linux version has been tested under <a
href="http://www.redhat.com/" target="_top">Red Hat</a> Linux 6.1
(and later releases) for x86 but should work
under most Linux variants. The Windows version has been tested under <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/" target="_top">Microsoft</a> Windows NT 4.0
and also works under Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows 2000. However,
please note that although successes have been reported, building the eCos
development tools under Windows 95 or Windows 98 has been found to be
unreliable, and we recommend avoiding building the development tools on
these systems if possible.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Instructions for downloading and installing eCos are available for both
Windows and Linux users. Each download includes eCos sources, documentation, host tool
sources and appropriate host tool binaries.
