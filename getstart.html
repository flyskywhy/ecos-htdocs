<h3>Host support</h3>

The eCos sourceware distribution is available in both Linux
and Windows versions. The Linux version has been tested under <a
href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a> Linux 5.x but should work
under most Linux variants. The Windows version has been tested under <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> Windows NT 4.0 and also
works under Windows 95 and Windows 98. However, please note that it is not possible to
build the eCos development tools under Windows 95 or Windows 98 at this time.
