<H2>Installing eCos under Windows</H2>
<HR SIZE=3>

<h3>Important note</h3>

The eCos host tools and GNU development tools are dependent on the forthcoming full release of the 
<a href="../cygwin/">Cygwin</a> tools (scheduled 2000-03-29). It will not
be possible to build eCos on Windows hosts prior to the release of the new Cygwin tools.

<h3>Downloading eCos</h3>

The eCos 1.3.1 distribution for Windows is provided as a self-extracting
executable file. Click on the following link to download:

<ul>
<li><A HREF="ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/ecos/eCos131.exe">eCos 1.3.1 for Windows</A> (eCos131.exe - 16MB)
</ul>

You may prefer to use one of the <a href="mirror.html">eCos mirror sites</a> to reduce download time, or if the FTP server is temporarily overloaded.
<p>

eCos also requires the GNU native tools for building the development tools and eCos packages. Windows users
should obtain the forthcoming full release of the
<a href="../cygwin/">Cygwin</a> tools (scheduled 2000-03-29).
Note that the Cygwin tools also include the <i>bzip2</i> utility required to extract development tool sources.

<h3>Installing eCos</h3>

<ol>
<li>Install the Cygwin native tools according to instructions provided
on the <a href="../cygwin/">Cygwin web site</a>.<p>

<li>Install eCos by running the downloaded distribution file and
following the on-screen instructions. Note that it is not possible to upgrade an existing eCos installation.
Any previous installations should be uninstalled (using the <i>Add/Remove Programs</i> utility in the
Control Panel) before installing eCos 1.3.1.
</ol>

<h3>Downloading and installing the development tools</h3>

In order to build the eCos sources, you will require a cross-compiler
and related development tools.

Instructions for downloading and building the tools vary depending
on the architecture to be supported. These instructions should be
followed from within the <i>bash</i> command-line environment
provide by Cygwin. Click on the required toolset for detailed instructions:
