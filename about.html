<h1>About eCos</h1>

<hr noshade size=3>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>eCos is provided as an open source runtime system supported by the
GNU open source development tools. Developers have full and
unfettered access to all aspects of the runtime system. No parts of it are
proprietary or hidden, and you are at liberty to examine, add to, and modify
the code as you deem necessary. These rights are granted to you and
protected by the <a href="license-overview.html">eCos license</a>. It also grants you the
right to freely develop and distribute applications based on eCos. We
welcome all contributions back to eCos such as
board ports, device drivers and other components, as this helps the growth
and development of eCos, and is of benefit to the entire eCos community.</p>

<p>One of the key technological innovations in eCos is the configuration
system. The configuration system allows the application writer to impose
their requirements on the run-time components, both in terms of their
functionality and implementation, whereas traditionally the operating system
has constrained the application's own implementation. Essentially, this
enables eCos developers to create their own application-specific operating
system and makes eCos suitable for a wide range of embedded uses.
Configuration also ensures that the resource footprint of eCos is minimized
as all unnecessary functionality and features are removed. The configuration
system also presents eCos as a component architecture. This provides a
standardized mechanism for component suppliers to extend the functionality
of eCos and allows applications to be built from a wide set of optional
configurable run-time components. Components can be provided from a variety
of sources including the standard eCos release, commercial third party
developers and open source contributors.</p>

<p>The royalty-free nature of eCos means that you can develop and deploy your
application using the standard eCos release without incurring any royalty
charges. In addition, there are no up-front license charges for the eCos
runtime source code and associated tools. eCos delivers, without charge,
everything necessary for basic embedded applications development.</p>

<p>eCos is designed to be portable to a wide range of target architectures and
target platforms including 16, 32, and 64 bit architectures, MPUs, MCUs and
DSPs. The eCos kernel, libraries and runtime components are layered on the
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), and thus will run on any target once the
HAL and relevant device drivers have been ported to the target's processor
architecture and board. Currently eCos supports 13 different target
architectures:<p>
<ul>
<li>68K/ColdFire</li>
<li>ARM (including ARM7TDMI, ARM9TDMI, Cortex-M, StrongARM, XScale)</li>
<li>CalmRISC16 and CalmRISC32 (RedBoot only)</li>
<li>Fujitsu FR-V</li>
<li>Fujitsu FR30</li>
<li>Hitachi H8/300</li>
<li>Intel x86</li>
<li>Matsushita AM3x</li>
<li>MIPS</li>
<li>NEC V8xx</li>
<li>PowerPC</li>
<li>SPARC</li>
<li>SuperH</li>
</ul>
<p>Support includes many of the popular variants of these architectures and
evaluation boards. Many new ports are in development and will be released as
they become available.</p>

<p>eCos has been designed to support applications with real-time requirements,
providing features such as full preemptability, minimal interrupt latencies,
and all the necessary synchronization primitives, scheduling policies, and
interrupt handling mechanisms needed for these type of applications. eCos
also provides all the functionality required for general embedded
application support including device drivers, memory management, exception
handling, C, math libraries, etc. In addition to runtime support, the eCos
system includes all the tools necessary to develop embedded applications,
including eCos software configuration and build tools, and GNU based
compilers, assemblers, linkers, debuggers, and simulators.</p>

	<LI>Choice of memory allocators</LI>
	<LI>Debug and instrumentation support</LI>
      </UL>
  <LI><A HREF="http://www.assoc.tron.org/itron/home-e.html">&micro;ITRON</A> 3.0 compatible API</LI>
  <LI>POSIX</A> compatible API</LI>
  <LI>ISO C and math libraries
  <LI>Serial, ethernet, SPI, I<sup>2</sup>C, framebuffer, CAN, ADC, wallclock and watchdog device drivers
  <LI>USB slave support
  <LI>TCP/IP networking stacks
  <LI>GDB debug support
</UL>

<h2>System requirements</h2>

<p>The eCos net distribution is available in both Linux
and Windows versions. The Linux version is tested under recent
versions of the Fedora, openSUSE and Ubuntu distributions for x86 and should work
under most Linux variants. The Windows version has been tested under Microsoft
Windows 2000 Professional, Windows XP and Windows Vista. It should also work
under Windows NT4 with SP6a. The use of eCos under Windows 95/98/ME is no-longer
supported.</p>

<p>The eCos net distribution is supplied with full support for configuration of eCos
on all host platforms via both a graphical configuration tool and a
command-line tool. It is intended to be used in conjunction with GNU development
tools which are available freely on the net. As a minimum, the <i>gcc</i> compiler,
<i>gdb</i> debugger and <i>binutils</i> tools are required to build eCos, link with
application code and undertake debugging.</p>
