<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p>
eCos is an infrastructure for developing embedded applications.  It
consists of:

<ul>
  <li>A configuration system which presents eCos as a <i>component
      architecture</i>, and allows fine-grained configuration of each
      component.  Using the configuration system you can compose your
      own operating system and fine-tune it to do what your
      application needs.
  <li>Host-side libraries and tools to support this configuration
      infrastructure.
  <li>A real time kernel.
  <li>An ISO standard C and math library.
  <li>An implementation of the &micro;ITRON operating system, running
      on top of the eCos kernel.
  <li>A collection of device drivers (not too many so far).
  <li>GDB and simulator support for the target CPUs, so that you can
      run and debug both in simulation and on real hardware.
</ul>

<p> eCos's kernel and runtime components are open source software, and
we encourage you to participate in the development of eCos.

<p> For a description of our goals, please read the <a
href="ecos-docs/tutorials/ecos-tutorial/foreword.html">Foreword</a> in
the <a href="ecos-docs/index.html">eCos online documentation</a>.

<h3>What platforms are supported?</h3>

<h4>Target architectures</h4>

<p> At the time I write this, 1998-10-28, the following CPUs are
supported:

<ul>
  <li>Matsushita MN10300
  <li>Toshiba TX39
  <li>PowerPC
</ul>

<h4>Host operating systems</h4>

<p> At the time I write this, 1998-10-28, the following host operating
systems are supported:

<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, Windows 98, Windows 95
  <li>UNIX (Linux in particular)
</ul>

<h3>Compilers, debuggers and simulators</h3>

<p> ecos requires some new features from the GNU compiler toolchain,
and we have made these new versions available here to accompany this
release.

<p> The version of GDB provided here has support for the MN10300, TX39
and PowerPC simulators.
