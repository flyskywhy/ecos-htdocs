<h3>eCos News</h3>

<h4>Hardware support</h4>

Hardware support has been extended to many new boards and sub-systems recently:

<ul>
<li>ARM development board (PID) big-endian mode
<li>ARM evaluation board (AEB-1) revision C and watchdog support
<li>Cirrus Logic CL-PS7111 development board
<li>Cogent CMA230 CPU module (ARM7TDMI)
<li>Motorola MBX860 embedded controller board
<li>PCI bus control
</ul>

The new hardware support packages are available via
<A href="anoncvs.html">anonymous CVS</a> only at this time. Full details of
all supported hardware are provided in the <a href="hardware.html">supported targets</a>
table. For the very latest news on eCos, check out the
<!-- rev=1 gives the latest version of a file via CVSweb -->

NEWS</a> file.

<h4>Sourceware CD</H4>

The eCos sources and development tools are now available on CD-ROM for
those who prefer not to download them directly. The
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/sourcewarecd/">Cygnus Sourceware CD</a>
includes both the eCos 1.2.1 sources and the earlier eCos 1.1 files.

<h4>Anonymous CVS access</h4>

Cygnus Solutions strongly believes in the benefits of open development and, to encourage this,
it is now possible to obtain the most recent versions of eCos using
<A href="anoncvs.html">anonymous CVS access</a>.
This facility will provide immediate access to the latest eCos features and the
rapid deployment of any necessary bug fixes.

<h3>About eCos</h3>

The embedded Cygnus operating system (eCos) is an open-source,
configurable, portable, and royalty-free embedded RTOS. The system
comes with everything necessary to develop eCos based applications,
including tools, documentation and complete sources. All eCos runtime
source code is distributed under the Cygnus eCos Public License
(CEPL), a derivative of the Netscape Public License.

<H3>Supported hosts</H3>
<P>
The main supported host is Windows NT on x86-based hardware. The
system has also been tested on Red Hat 5.x Linux (and later releases) using x86-based
hardware, and on both Windows 95 and 98, but support for these hosts
should be considered beta. In addition to the tested host platforms,
eCos has been hosted on Linux using PowerPC hardware and on Solaris 2.5.1.
<P>
<H3>Host software</H3>
<P>
The system comes with full support for manual configuration of the
system on all host platforms. In addition Windows users get a
graphical configuration tool which simplifies the process of
configuring a system and validating the resulting system. This tool is
not yet available for Linux users. It has, however, been used successfully with
Windows NT 4.0 running as a guest operating system under
<A HREF="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware for Linux</A>. It is likely that new host tools,
including future versions of the graphical configuration tool, will
only be available as part of the Developer Kit product.
<P>
The system comes with a full set of tools needed for embedded systems
development. This includes the <i>gcc</i> and <i>g++</i> compilers, the assembler
and linker and the <i>gdb</i> debugger. Simulators are provided for most
of the target architectures.
