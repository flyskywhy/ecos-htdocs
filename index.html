<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>eCos is an open source, royalty-free, real-time operating system intended for
embedded applications. The highly configurable nature of eCos allows the
operating system to be customised to precise application requirements, delivering
the best possible run-time performance and an optimised hardware resource
footprint. A thriving net community has grown up around the operating system
ensuring on-going technical innovation and wide platform support.</p>

<p>For further information concerning eCos, please refer to the
<a href="about.html">about eCos</a> page. eCos is not related to the Linux
operating system.</p>
