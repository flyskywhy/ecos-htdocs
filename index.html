<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>eCos is an open source, royalty-free, real-time operating system intended for
embedded applications. The highly configurable nature of eCos allows the
operating system to be customised to precise application requirements, delivering
the best possible run-time performance and an optimised hardware resource
footprint. A thriving net community has grown up around the operating system
ensuring on-going technical innovation and wide platform support.</p>

<p>For further information concerning eCos, please refer to the
<a href="about.html">about eCos</a> page. eCos is not related to the Linux
operating system.</p>

<td><b>Red Hat contributes eCos copyright to Free Software Foundation</b>

<p><a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a> today <a href="http://www.redhat.com/about/presscenter/2004/press_eCosFSF.html">
announced their intention</a> to transfer all their copyright in eCos to the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>. This will  consolidate the legal standing of eCos, and is a great benefit to the eCos community.</p>

<p>As eCos transitions to becoming an FSF project, there will be a number of changes, especially to the copyright assignment process for new contributions among other things. Please bear with us during this transitional period as we make updates.</p>

<td><b>IBM PowerPC 405GP support</b>

<p>
The PPC40x variant support has been improved, adding fairly
complete support for the 405GP.  
Note: although the PC40x variant has been in our tree for years, 
it has not been used by any published platforms.
</p>
<p>
This is the first public
platform to use the PPC40x framework is
the new MOAB development board, from Test & Measurement Systems.

<td><b>Improved Motorola Power-QUICC2 support</b>

<p>
The QUICC2 variant support has been reworked as <em>mpc8xxx</em>
and should now be more flexible for platforms based on these 
new devices.
</p>
<p>
The first port to take advantage of this new layout is support for
the new Analogue & Micro Rattler, which is outfitted with either
a MPC8250 or MPC8270.
