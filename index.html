<h2 align=center>eCos<br>the Embedded Cygnus Operating System</h2>
<br clear=all>

<p>Cygnus has developed a complete 
<a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/">Sourceware</a> real time operating
system called <b>eCos</b>, the <i>Embedded Cygnus Operating System</i>.
eCos allows fine-grained configuration of the kernel and other components,
thus making it possible to write applications with a very small footprint.
eCos is also very portable and allows other operating systems to
be implemented with alternative configurations of the eCos kernel.
The current release includes a &micro;ITRON compatibility layer.

<p>The first full net release will occur on November 2nd, 1998 and will
include complete source code for multiple processor platforms, all kernel
components, HAL layers, &micro;ITRON API, C run-time, math libraries,
and drivers.

<p>We are making preliminary information available right now, including
the full documentation for two initial platforms (the Matsushita MN10300
and the Toshiba TX39) and the <a href="license.html">Cygnus eCos Public
License</a>, under which eCos will be released.

<p>There is a lot of useful information on the 
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ecos/">eCos Product Page</a>, including FAQs
and endorsements.  We'll have more information about third-party software
vendors, support and development services on this page on November 2nd.

<p>There is a mailing list for announcements, <code>ecos-announce</code>.
You can sign up to this list to hear about eCos developments as they

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>We have the full documentation for our initial two platforms
available on-line right now.

<ul>
  <li><a href="docs/mn10300/">eCos 1.0 for MN10300 documentation</a>
  <li><a href="docs/tx39/">eCos 1.0 for TX39 documentation</a>
</ul>

<p>All of the documentation was written in 
<a href="http://www.ora.com/davenport/">Docbook</a>, an SGML DTD for writing
software documentation.  All of the HTML here was generated with Mark
Galassi's <a href="ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/home/rosalia/docware/">Docbook
free toolchain RPMs</a>.  At the heart of all of this is James Clark's
<a href="http://www.jclark.com/jade/">Jade</a> and Norm Walsh's 
<a href="http://www.nwalsh.com/docbook/dsssl/index.html">Docbook DSSSL
stylesheets</a>.
