<h1 align=center>eCos, the Embedded Cygnus Operating System</h1>

<p> Cygnus is developing a complete open source real time operating
system called eCos, the <i>Embedded Cygnus Operating System</i>.  eCos
allows fine-grained configuration of the kernel and other components,
thus making it possible to write applications with a very small
footprint.

<p> The first full net release of eCos will occur in late November, at
which time a grand announcement will be made.  Until then we are
making the complete HTML documentation available for the two principal
supported platforms: the Matsushita MN10300 and the Toshiba TX39.  We
are also making mailing lists available and disclosing our license.

<h2>The documentation</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="docs/mn10300/index.html">MN10300 documentation</a>
  <li><a href="docs/tx39/index.html">TX39 documentation</a>
</ul>

<h2>Mailing lists</h2>

<p>We have two mailing lists set up for our eCos related work,
<code>ecos-announce@sourceware.cygnus.com</code> and
<code>ecos-discuss@sourceware.cygnus.com</code>.
<code>ecos-announce</code> is a low-volume, moderated list which will
have announcements related to this project.  <code>java-discuss</code>
is an open list where people are invited to discuss the software we're
releasing, ask questions, post patches, etc.  Both are majordomo-run
lists, or you can subscribe with the entry boxes below:
