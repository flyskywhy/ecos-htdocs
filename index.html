<h3>eCos News</h3>

<h4>Sourceware CD</H4>

The eCos sources and development tools are now available on CD-ROM for
those who prefer not to download them directly. The
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/sourcewarecd/">Cygnus Sourceware CD</a>
includes both the latest eCos 1.2.1 sources and the earlier eCos 1.1 files.

<h4>eCos 1.2.1 release</h4>

The second public release of eCos is now available. Since the original eCos 1.1 release, Cygnus has continued its development
adding a wealth of new features and additional ports. eCos 1.2.1 incorporates the following enhancements:

<ul>
<li>New architectures:<p> 
  <ul>
  <li>Advanced RISC Machines ARM7
  <li>Fujitsu SPARClite MB8683x series of processors
  </ul>

<p>In addition to the new architectures, PowerPC support has been extended to include the MPC850 and MPC823 variants.

<p><li>Several new evaluation board ports:<p>
  <ul>
  <li>ARM PID7T
  <li>ARM AEB-1 (beta)
  <li>Cogent CMA287-50 - PowerPC MPC850
  <li>Cogent CMA287-23 - PowerPC MPC823
  <li>Motorola FADS860 (unsupported contributed port)
  <li>Fujitsu MB8683x evaluation boards
  </ul>

<p><li>New tools features:<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Synthetic target support under Linux x86 - run eCos apps natively under Linux
  <li>Configuration Tool - built-in support for eCos testcase execution
  <li>Configuration Tool - memory layout editor, simplifying the task of mapping eCos to your system’s memory map
  <li>Configuration Tool - miscellaneous enhancements including progress bar for most operations
  <li>Enhanced GDB multithreading support - user control of scheduler locking while debugging
  <li>Enhanced GDB download protocol - halving the download time over serial connections
  </ul>

<p><li>New or extended runtime features:<p>
  <ul>
  <li>New eCos device driver architecture - including revised serial drivers for all supported boards
  <li>Standardized kernel device driver API
  <li>ISO C library now includes support for signals and date/time functions
  <li>CygMon ROM monitor support for the SPARClite evaluation boards, including ethernet based download and debug
  <li>Updated and expanded documentation including the new ports and device driver architecture
  <li>Expanded testsuite
  <li>A wealth of minor enhancements and bug fixes
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Anonymous CVS access</h4>

Cygnus Solutions strongly believes in the benefits of open development and, to encourage this,
it is now possible to obtain the most recent versions of eCos using
<A href="anoncvs.html">anonymous CVS access</a>.
This facility will provide immediate access to the latest eCos features and the
rapid deployment of any necessary bug fixes.

<h3>About eCos</h3>

The embedded Cygnus operating system (eCos) is an open-source,
configurable, portable, and royalty-free embedded RTOS. The system
comes with everything necessary to develop eCos based applications,
including tools, documentation and complete sources. All eCos runtime
source code is distributed under the Cygnus eCos Public License
(CEPL), a derivative of the Netscape Public License.

<p>
The following functionality is provided:<p>
<UL>
  <LI>Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)</LI>
  <LI>Real-time kernel</LI>
      <UL>
	<LI>Interrupt handling</LI>
	<LI>Exception handling</LI>
	<LI>Choice of schedulers</LI>
	<LI>Thread support</LI>
	<LI>Rich set of synchronization primitives</LI>
	<LI>Timers, counters and alarms</LI>
	<LI>Choice of memory allocators</LI>
	<LI>Debug and instrumentation support</LI>
      </UL>
  <LI><A HREF="http://www.itron.gr.jp/">&micro;ITRON</A> 3.0 compatible API layered on top of the basic kernel</LI>
  <LI>ISO C and math libraries
  <LI>Serial device drivers
  <LI>GDB debug support
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Supported hosts</H3>
<P>
The main supported host is Windows NT on x86-based hardware. The
system has also been tested on Red Hat 5.x Linux using x86-based
hardware, and on both Windows 95 and 98, but support for these hosts
should be considered beta. In addition to the tested host platforms,
eCos has been hosted on Linux using PowerPC hardware and on Solaris 2.5.1.
<P>
<H3>Host software</H3>
<P>
The system comes with full support for manual configuration of the
system on all host platforms. In addition Windows users get a
graphical configuration tool which simplifies the process of
configuring a system and validating the resulting system. This tool is
not yet available for Linux users. It has, however, been used successfully with
Windows NT 4.0 running as a guest operating system under
<A HREF="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware for Linux</A>. It is likely that new host tools,
including future versions of the graphical configuration tool, will
only be available as part of the Developer Kit product.
<P>
The system comes with a full set of tools needed for embedded systems
development. This includes the <i>gcc</i> and <i>g++</i> compilers, the assembler
and linker and the <i>gdb</i> debugger. Simulators are provided for most
of the target architectures.
