<h1 align=center>eCos, the Embedded Cygnus Operating System</h1>

<p> Cygnus has developed a complete <a
href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/">sourceware</a> real time
operating system called eCos, the <i>Embedded Cygnus Operating
System</i>.  eCos allows fine-grained configuration of the kernel and
other components, thus making it possible to write applications with a
very small footprint.

<p> The first full net release of eCos will occur on November 2nd,
1998, at which time a grand announcement will be made.  Until then we
are making the complete HTML documentation available for the two
principal supported platforms: the Matsushita MN10300 and the Toshiba
TX39.  We are now making the announcement mailing list available and
disclosing our license.

<h2>The documentation</h2>

<h2>Mailing list</h2>

<p>We have a mailing lists set up for our eCos related work,
<code>ecos-announce@sourceware.cygnus.com</code>.
<code>ecos-announce</code> is a low-volume, moderated list which will
have announcements related to this project.  A discussion list will be
