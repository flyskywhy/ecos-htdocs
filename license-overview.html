<h1>eCos License Overview</h1>
<HR noshade SIZE=3>

<p>eCos is released under the <A HREF="license.html">Red Hat eCos Public License</A>
(RHEPL). The goal of the license is to serve the eCos user community as a
whole. It allows all eCos users to develop products without paying
anybody anything, no matter how many developers are working on the
product or how many units will be shipped. The eCos source code will
always be freely available. This applies not only to the core system
itself but also to any changes that anybody makes to the core. In
particular it should prevent any company or individual contributing
code to the system and then, maybe after waiting six months or so,
claim that all eCos users are now guilty of copyright or patent
infringements and have to pay royalties. It should also prevent any
company from making some small improvements, calling the result a
completely new system, and releasing this under a new and less
generous license.</p>

<P>The license does <B>NOT</B> require users to release the source code
of any applications that are developed with eCos. The only obligation
it imposes on application developers is to include a
<A HREF="license.html#exhibit-b">notice</A> with your product indicating that it
makes use of eCos. It is not even necessary to inform Red Hat that this
has happened, the inclusion of the notice is sufficient.</p>

<p>However, if anybody makes any changes to code covered by the eCos
public license then we believe that the entire user community should
have the opportunity to benefit from that change. Therefore any such
changes must be made publicly available and announced to the user
community, for example by means of a posting to the <A
HREF="intouch.html">ecos-discuss</A> mailing list. Obviously not every
change will be incorporated into the system, but the decisions will be
made by the eCos maintainers. A <a href="assign.html">copyright
assignment</a> will be required for any significant changes to the core
eCos packages.</p>


<p>The result is a royalty-free system with minimal obligations on the
part of application developers, which should result in a rapid uptake
of eCos. At the same time eCos is fully open source with all the
benefits that implies in terms of quality and innovation. We believe
that this is a winning combination.</p>
