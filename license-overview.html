<h1>eCos License Overview</h1>
<HR noshade SIZE=3>

<p>As of May 2002, eCos is released under a modified version of the
well known <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General
Public License (GPL)</a>. The eCos license is officially recognised as a
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses">
GPL-compatible Free Software License</a>. An exception clause has been added
which limits the circumstances in which the license applies
to other code when used in conjunction with eCos. The exception clause is
as follows:</p>

<ul><tt>
 As a special exception, if other files instantiate templates or use macros
 or inline functions from this file, or you compile this file and link it
 with other works to produce a work based on this file, this file does not
 by itself cause the resulting work to be covered by the GNU General Public
 License. However the source code for this file must still be made
 available in accordance with section (3) of the GNU General Public
 License.<br><br>

 This exception does not invalidate any other reasons why a work based on
 this file might be covered by the GNU General Public License.</tt></ul>

<p>The goal of the license is to serve the eCos user community as a
whole. It allows all eCos users to develop products without paying
anybody anything, no matter how many developers are working on the
product or how many units will be shipped. The license also guarantees
that the eCos source code will
always be freely available. This applies not only to the core eCos code
itself but also to any changes that anybody makes to the core. In
particular, it should prevent any company or individual contributing
code to the system and then later claiming that all eCos users are
now guilty of copyright or patent
infringements and have to pay royalties. It should also prevent any
company from making some small improvements, calling the result a
completely new system, and releasing this under a new and less
generous license.</p>

<P>The license does <i>not</i> require users to release the source code
of any <i>applications</i> that are developed with eCos. However, if anybody
makes any changes to code covered by the eCos license, or writes new files
derived in any way from eCos code, then we believe that the entire user community should
have the opportunity to benefit from this. The license stipulates that
these changes must be made available in source code form to all recipients
of binaries based on the modified code, either by including the sources along with the
binaries you deliver (or with any device containing such binaries) or
with a written offer to supply the source code to the general public
for three years. It is perhaps most practical for eCos developers to
make the source code available online and inform those who are
receiving binaries containing eCos code, and probably also the eCos
maintainers, about the location of the code. See the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">full text of the GPL </a>
for the most authoritative definition of the obligations.</p>

<p>Although it is not strictly necessary to contribute the modified code back to the
eCos open source project, we are always pleased to receive code contributions
and hope that developers will also be keen to give back in return for what
they received from the eCos project completely free of charge.
The eCos maintainers are responsible for deciding whether such contributions
should be applied to the public repository. In addition, a
<a href="assign.html">copyright assignment</a> is required for any
significant changes to the core eCos packages.</p>

<p>The result is a royalty-free system with minimal obligations on the
part of application developers. This has resulted in the rapid uptake
of eCos. At the same time, eCos is fully open source with all the
benefits that implies in terms of quality and innovation. We believe
that this is a winning combination.</p>

<h2>Questions and answers</h2>

<p>The following queries provide some clarification as to the implications
of the eCos license. They do not consititute part of the legal meaning of the license.</p>

<p><b>Q.</b> What is the effect of the eCos license?</p>

<p><b>A.</b> In the simplest terms, when you distribute anything containing eCos code,
you must make the source code to eCos available under the terms of the GPL.</p>

<p><b>Q.</b> What if I make changes to eCos, or write new code based on eCos code?</p>

<p><b>A.</b> Then you must make those changes available as well.</p>

<p><b>Q.</b> Do I have to distribute the source code to my application? Isn't the GPL
"viral"?</p>

<p><b>A.</b> You do not have to distribute any code under the terms of the GPL other than
eCos code or code derived from eCos. For example, if you write a HAL port
based on copying an existing eCos HAL in any way, you must make the source code available with
the binary. However you would not need to make available any other code,
such as the code of a wholly separate application linked with eCos.</p>

<p><b>Q.</b> I would rather stick with the RHEPL code, but I updated my anonymous CVS
checkout.</p>

<p><b>A.</b> You can check out the final version of anonymous CVS before the license
change using the CVS tag <tt><i>last-rhepl</i></tt>. See
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/ecos/anoncvs.html">the anonymous CVS access page</a>
for details.</p>

<h2>Previous license</h2>

Prior to May 2002, eCos was released under the
<a href="old-license.html">Red Hat eCos Public License (RHEPL)</a>. The RHEPL
required any modifications to eCos code to be made available under preferential
terms to Red Hat and was therefore incompatible with code licensed under the GPL.
The use of eCos source code which was licensed under the RHEPL is not affected by the
switch to the modified GPL for later revisions.

<h2>Full eCos license</h2>

<p>This is the full text of the license as found on files within eCos covered
by the eCos license. It should be read in conjuction
with the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General
Public License (GPL)</a> on which it depends.</p>
