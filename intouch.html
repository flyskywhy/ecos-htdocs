<h2>Mailing lists</h2>

<p>There are two principal mailing lists relating to eCos. Subscribers to the
<nobr><i>ecos-announce</i></nobr> list will receive details of all eCos
developments as they unfold. This is a moderated list intended principally
for the announcement of new packages, snapshots and patches. Subscribers to
the <nobr><i>ecos-discuss</i></nobr> list can participate in open discussion
with others concerning all aspects of eCos. This is an unmoderated list.
Archives of both the <a HREF="/ml/ecos-announce/">ecos-announce</a> and
<a href="/ml/ecos-discuss/">ecos-discuss</a> mailing lists are available.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend you read both the eCos documentation fully
and search the above mail archives before asking simple questions
on the discussion list, particularly if they are likely to be problems
that people would have encountered before.</p>

<p>There are additional mailing lists specifically for those requiring
notification of changes at this site. Subscribers to the
<nobr><i>ecos-cvs</i></nobr> list will receive notification of any changes to
the eCos anonymous CVS repository.  <a href="/ml/ecos-cvs/">Archives of
ecos-cvs</a> are also available.  Subscribers to the
<nobr><i>ecos-webpages-cvs</i></nobr> list will receive notification of any
changes to the eCos web pages.</p>

<p>To subscribe to any of these mailing lists, use the mailing list request
form below. Digest versions of each list are also available where messages
are forwarded on a daily basis. If you are experiencing problems with the use
of these mailing lists, please refer to the
<a href="/lists.html#faqs" target="_top">mailing list FAQ</a>.</p>
