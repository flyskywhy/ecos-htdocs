<h3>Mailing lists</h3>

There are two principal mailing lists relating to eCos. Subscribers
to the <nobr><i>ecos-announce</i></nobr> list will receive details
of all eCos developments as they unfold. This is a moderated list
intended principally for the announcement of new packages, snapshots and
patches. Subscribers to the <nobr><i>ecos-discuss</i></nobr> list can participate
in open discussion with others concerning all aspects of eCos. This is an
unmoderated list. Archives of both the <a HREF="/ml/ecos-announce/">ecos-announce</a> and <a href="/ml/ecos-discuss/">ecos-discuss</a> mailing lists are available.<p>

There are additional mailing lists specifically for
those requiring notification of changes at this site. Subscribers to the <nobr><i>ecos-cvs</i></nobr> list will receive notification of any
changes to the eCos anonymous CVS repository.  <a href="/ml/ecos-cvs/">Archives of ecos-cvs</a> are also available. 
Subscribers to the <nobr><i>ecos-webpages-cvs</i></nobr> list will receive notification of any
changes to the eCos web pages.<p>

To subscribe to any of these mailing lists, use the mailing list request form below.
Digest versions of each list are also available where messages are forwarded on a daily basis.
If you are experiencing problems with
the use of these mailing lists, please refer to the
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/lists.html#faqs">mailing list FAQ</a>.
