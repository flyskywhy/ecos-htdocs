  Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future
  version of this License released under <a href="#section-6.1">Section
  6.1</a>, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of
  the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms
  on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
  version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However,

  Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be

  via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom
  you made an Executable version available and to the Initial Developer;
  and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain
  available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially
  became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
  version of that particular Modification has been made available to
  such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
  version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism
  is maintained by a third party. You are responsible for notifying the
  Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source
  if a contact means is provided. Cygnus will be acting as maintainer
  of the Source and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for
  the Modification to be made available. You can contact Cygnus to make
  the Modification available and to notify the Initial Developer.  (<a

       utilization under this License), you must include a text file
       with the source code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which
       describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient
       detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain
       such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as
       described in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>, You shall
       promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available
       thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
       appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated
       to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge
       has been obtained.

  may add your name as a Contributor to the Source Code.  If it is not
  possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to
  its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such

  recipients of Covered Code.

  <p>However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
  the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
  clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation
  is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
  Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the

  or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the
  rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
  version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear
  that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone,
  not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
  indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
  incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
  any such terms You offer.

DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE

(NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
