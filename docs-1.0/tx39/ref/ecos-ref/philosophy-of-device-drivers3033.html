>	The device drivers shipped with

> are written in C++, as is the
	eCos kernel.  An <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>IORB</SPAN
> base class (along
	with derived classes for use with serial drivers) is provided,
	and users can derive their own classes for I/O request
	management from this class.</P
><P
>	  The mechanism for generating function tables from the C++
	  I/O classes is also only available for C++ programmers.
	  Note, though, that these mechanisms are only needed by
	  somewhat more complex device drivers that need request queue
	  management or integration to standard I/O. Simpler device
	  drivers can be written in C with no loss.
	</P
><P
>	  There is a drawback to writing device drivers in C++: the
	  first is that in this version of
	  <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
>, the C++ kernl API is not
	  yet standardized, and is subject to change.  In contrast the
	  C system call interface (<A
HREF="native-kernel-c-language-api.html"
>Chapter 5</A
>) is standardized
	  and documented.  In addition, many embedded system
	  programmers are accustomed to writing device drivers in
	  C.</P
><P
>	  Future versions of eCos will present a stable kernel C++
	  API, as well as mechanisms for C device drivers to use IORBs
	  and connect with standard I/O.
