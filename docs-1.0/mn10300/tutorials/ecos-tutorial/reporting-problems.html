>	We have tried to ensure that it is as easy as possible for you
	to report any problems which may occur while you develop
	applications using <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
>. This is
	because we wish both to help you with any difficulties and to
	take every opportunity to improve our software. Cygnus has a
	reputation for its responsiveness to bug reports in all its
	products. Maintaining and developing that reputation is an
	integral part of the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> project.
	We will be able to most successfully address the problems you
	report if you provide as much detail describing the problems
	as possible.</P

	supplying us with information about any problems you
	encounter.</P

	need assistance with English language translation or in filing
	Problem Reports, please contact Nihon Cygnus using the
	email address, telephone number or postal address you received
