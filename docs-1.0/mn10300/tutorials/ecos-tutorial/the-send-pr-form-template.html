>"&#62;Submitter-Id:"
     Critical information.
     Toshiba Submitter ID:  toshiba-ecc
"&#62;Originator:"
     Full name of the submitter.
"&#62;Organization:"
     The name of the originator's company or parent organization.
"&#62;Confidential:"
     Cygnus changes this to "no" only when information is no
     longer sensitive for the customer, or if the sender does
     not have a support contract.
     yes is the default
"&#62;Synopsis:"
     This should reflect the Subject: field and be a single line.
"&#62;Severity:"
    Use one of the following values:

    "non-critical"    The product, component or concept is working
                      in general, but lacks features, has irritating
                      behavior, does something wrong, or doesn't
                      match its documentation.
    "serious"        The product, component or concept is not
                      working properly. Problems that would otherwise
                      be considered "critical" are rated "serious"
                      when a workaround is known.
    "critical"        The product, component or concept is completely
                      non-operational or some essential functionality
                      is missing. No workaround is known.

     The default is "serious."
"&#62;Priority:"
     How soon the originator requires a solution. Use one of the
     following values:

    "low"             The problem to be solved in a future release.
    "medium"          The problem to be solved in the next release,
                      if possible.
    "high"            A solution is needed as soon as possible.

The default is "medium."

"&#62;Category:"
     Critical information.
     Choose from the table of valid categories.

     bfd          binutils    build
     byacc        config      diff
     doc          dos         ecc
     expect       g++         gdb
     flex         gas         gcc
     gcov         glob        gprof
     help-request id-request  info
     info-request install     ld
     libc         libg++      libiberty
     libm         make        makeinfo
     mgmt         netware     other
     patch        query-pr    readline
     send-pr      sim         shipping
     tcl          test        testsuites
     texindex     texinfo

"&#62;Class:"
     The class of a problem uses one of the following subjects
     as input:

    "sw-bug"           A general product problem.
                       ("sw" stands for software.)
    "doc-bug"          A problem with the documentation.
    "change-request"   A request for a change in behavior, etc.
    "support"          A support problem or question.

     The default is "sw-bug".

"&#62;Release:"
     Critical information.
     Provide release or version number of the product, component
     or concept-for example, "progressive-97r1" or, for custom
     contracts, "chipname-yymmdd".
"&#62;Environment:"
     Description of the environment where the problem occurred:
     machine architecture, operating system, host and target
     types, libraries, pathnames, etc.
"Architecture"
     For example, "solaris 2.5.1"
"System"
     For example, "sun4".
"&#62;Description:"
     Critical information.
     Provide a precise description of the problem.

"&#62;How-To-Repeat:"
     Example code, input, or activities to reproduce the
     problem. The support organization uses example code both to
     reproduce the problem and to test whether the problem is
     fixed. Include all preconditions, inputs, outputs,
     conditions after the problem, and symptoms. Include any
     additional important information, such as all the details,
     however obvious, that would be necessary for someone else
     to recreate the reported problem. Sometimes seemingly
     arbitrary or obvious information can point the way toward a
     solution.
"&#62;Fix:"
     How to work around the problem, if known.</PRE
