    <td valign=top>With a SPARClite target, kernel exceptions may not work as

		default configuration when building for the SPARClite
		evaluation board with RAM startup. This problem occurs
		because certain hardware exception vectors are handled
		directly by CygMon, rather than eCos. As a result, registering
		an exception handler for those exceptions will not have any
		effect. This problem is exhibited in the kernel	tests except1
		and kexcept1.</td>

    <td valign=top>HAL stack size symbols are not documented.</td>
    <td valign=top>HALs now define some symbols to make it easier to create stacks
		of a suitable size for the system in question, if writing code
		for many different eCos targets. This is target-dependent
		because of the varying memory needs for stack frames and for
		interrupt handling.<p>
 
		The supported symbols are:<p>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CYGNUM_HAL_STACK_SIZE_MINIMUM<br>
		and<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CYGNUM_HAL_STACK_SIZE_TYPICAL<p>

		which are recommended for a thread which does almost nothing,
		such as the idle thread and for one which makes substantial use
		of system calls, a more typical thread, respectively. If your
		threads have stack variables of any size, you should add their
		size (in bytes) to these symbols when defining your stacks.<p>

		If you enable asserts (CYGPKG_INFRA_DEBUG, CYGDBG_USE_ASSERTS),
		then threads with stack size smaller than
		CYGNUM_HAL_STACK_SIZE_MINIMUM will not be allowed to start; an
		assert will fire, halting the system.<p>

		These symbols are typically made up of others which may be
		defined depending on architecture; an example is
		CYGNUM_HAL_STACK_FRAME_SIZE which represents the stack space
		needed to make a function call.  See your cyg/hal/hal_arch.h
		file for details, or others that it includes, for the stack
		requirements may vary with the number of simultaneously active
		interrupt sources, for example.<p>
 
		In future releases, these sizes may change depending on
		configuration. Specifically, some target architectures are
		undergoing HAL improvements for future releases that will
		enable all interrupt processing code, including DSRs, to
		execute on a single separate dedicated stack; this will mean
		that normal thread stacks do not all need to have enough space
		for fielding all possible simultaneous interrupts, but instead
		just enough space to enter the interrupt system once.  This may
		reduce memory requirements considerably, depending on target,
		and so the values of these symbols will reduce to match in
		versions where this feature is supported.</td>
