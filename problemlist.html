    <td valign=top>Windows only problem. InstallShield incorrectly calculates the
		amount of disk free-space. It calculates available space on a
		character, not disk allocation unit basis. As the eCos
		distribution contains many small files, this can lead to
		installation being allowed to proceed when there is
		insufficient disk space available.</td>
    <td valign=top>Please manually check that enough disk space exists after
		consulting the installation requirements in the documentation.</td>

    <td valign=top>The Windows based eCos Configuration Tool does not support
		early versions of Internet Explorer - version 2 or earlier.
		When accessing help in the Configuration Tool, the browser
		may display errors regarding the URL that it was invoked
		with. This is due to an inability to handle URL fragments.</td>
    <td valign=top>Install Internet Explorer version 3 or later, or Netscape.
		Note that Netscape cannot however provide an integrated
		browser pane within the Configuration Tool.</td>

		command does not function correctly.</td>
    <td valign=top>Use gdb to load binaries into the target system using the GDB
		support built into CygMon. Optionally, on the TX39 we provide a
		simple srecord downloader "loaders/tx39-jmr3904/sload.bin"
		that can be used for this purpose.</td>

    <td valign=top>The TX39 simulator does not support simulation of the external
		interrupt configuration register (located at 0xffffe000). This
		correctly leads to the "intr0" and "kintr0" eCos testcases
		failing when run under the simulator.</td>

  <tr bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
    <td valign=top>17974</td>

  <tr bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
    <td valign=top>18007</td>
    <td valign=top>GDB cannot cope with executables whose absolute pathnames are
		longer than 128 characters. This is only a problem when gdb is
		used with hardware. The built in simulators are OK. The failure
		mode is that the application will download correctly, but then
		GDB terminates with an error.</td>

    <td valign=top>TX39 (Sourceware release only) problem connecting to simulated
		CygMon. Following the instructions in the documentation will
		not result in successful connection to a standalone simulator
		running a simulated CygMon.</td>
    <td valign=top>To connect to a simulated CygMon it is necessary to run GDB
		first, setting "target remote localhost:xxxx", and then

  <tr bgcolor="#DDDDDD">

  <tr bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
    <td valign=top>18110</td>
    <td valign=top>TX39 "si" and "ni" commands can cause problems in a
		multi-threaded environment. In certain circumstances GDB can
		get confused by a thread context switch when single stepping.
		This is a rare occurance, but results in control of the target
		being lost.</td>
    <td valign=top>If this occurs, hit ^C to regain control of the target.</td>

  <tr bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
    <td valign=top>18121</td>
    <td valign=top>No on-line GDBTk manual present (Developer's Kit only). The
		Developer's Kit comes with full printed documentation including
		a GDBTk manual. As an added bonus we have included a HTML
		version of this manual on the eCos 1.1 CD.</td>
    <td valign=top>The HTML version of the GDBTk manual can be found on the CD ROM
