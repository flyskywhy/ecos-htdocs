<h1>Installing Cygwin for use with eCos</h1>

<hr noshade size=3>

<h2>What is Cygwin?</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> is a UNIX emulation system for Microsoft Windows.
It provides a UNIX emulation library which enables many UNIX tools to be ported to run on Windows easily.
It also includes a selection of tools which provide a UNIX-like working environment.
The Windows versions of the eCos host tools make extensive use of Cygwin and it is
therefore <i>essential</i> to download and install Cygwin before installing eCos on Microsoft Windows.</p>

<h2>Running the Cygwin setup program</h2>

<p>Cygwin is most readily installed by downloading and executing the Cygwin setup program.
Click <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe">here</a> to run this program.
Most Windows web browsers will allow you to execute the program directly.
Some browsers may warn that there is no <i>Authenticode signature</i>.
Once the setup program has been downloaded and executed, the setup wizard will
guide you through the installation of Cygwin. The following options
in the setup wizard are recommended:</p>

<table width="100%"><COL WIDTH="0*"><COL WIDTH="*">
<tr valign=top><td>Choose&nbsp;a&nbsp;download&nbsp;source:&nbsp;</td><td><tt>install from internet</tt></td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td>Root directory:</td><td><tt>c:\cygwin</tt></td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td>Install for:</td><td><tt>all users</tt></td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td>Default text file type:</td><td><tt>DOS</tt></td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td>Local package directory:</td><td><tt>C:\cygwin-pkg</tt></td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td>Internet connection:</td><td><tt>direct connection</tt></td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td>Download site:</td><td>&lt;select a local site&gt;</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td>Select packages:</td><td>Click once on the <i>View</i> button to show the <i>Full</i> view.
    In addition to the packages which are installed by default, it is <i>essential</i> to install
    the following packages:<br>
<!--    <tt>autoconf, autoconf-devel, autoconf-stable, automake, automake-conf, automake-stable, binutils, bison, bzip2, cvs, dejagnu, gcc, gdb, less, make, more, patch, unzip, wget, zip</tt><br>-->
    <tt>gcc, make, sharutils, tcltk, wget</tt><br>
    Click once on the rotating arrows symbol against each of the above packages to select them for installation.
    This will also result in the automatic selection of a number of other packages on which the selected packages depend.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td>Create icons:</td><td>&lt;select both items&gt;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Once the Cygwin setup program has completed, it is possible to install eCos by invoking
the Cygwin bash shell using the desktop icon or the corresponding menu item and then following the
instructions on the eCos <a href="getstart.html">downloading and installation</a> page.</p>
