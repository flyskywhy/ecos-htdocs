>The way to assign copyright to Cygnus Solutions is to sign
an assignment contract. This is what makes Cygnus Solutions the
legal copyright holder so that Cygnus can register the copyright
on the new version. </P
><P
>If you are employed as a programmer (even at a university),
or have made an agreement with your employer or school that gives
them ownership of the software you write, then Cygnus needs a signed
letter from your employer disclaiming rights to the contributed
software. </P
><P
>The disclaimer should be printed on the company"s
headed paper, and signed by an officer of the company, or someone
authorized to license the company"s intellectual property.
Here is an example of wording that can be used for this purpose: </P
><P
>&#60;INSERT COMPANY NAME&#62; hereby disclaims all
copyright interest in the changes and enhancements made by &#60;INSERT
YOUR NAME&#62; to eCos, including any future revisions of these
changes and enhancements. </P
><P
>&#60;INSERT COMPANY NAME&#62; affirms that it has
no other intellectual property interest that would undermine this
release, or the use of eCos, and will do nothing to undermine it
in the future.</P

 eCos ASSIGNMENT

 For good and valuable consideration, receipt of which I acknowledge, I,
&#60;INSERT NAME OF CONTRIBUTOR&#62;, hereby transfer to Cygnus Solutions, Inc.
("Cygnus") my entire right, title, and interest (including all rights under
copyright) in my changes and enhancements to eCos, subject to the conditions
below. These changes and enhancements are herein called the "Work". The Work
hereby assigned shall also include any future revisions of these changes and
enhancements hereafter made by me.

 Upon thirty days" prior written notice, Cygnus agrees to grant me
non-exclusive rights to use the Work (i.e. just my changes and enhancements,
not eCos as a whole) as I see fit; (and Cygnus"s rights shall otherwise
continue unchanged).

 I hereby agree that if I have or acquire hereafter any patent or interface
copyright or other intellectual property interest dominating the software
enhanced by the Work (or use of that software), such dominating interest will
not be used to undermine the effect of this assignment, i.e. Cygnus and the
general public will be licensed to use, in that program and its derivative
works, without royalty or limitation, the subject matter of the dominating
interest. This license provision will be binding on my heirs, assignees, or
other successors to the dominating interest, as well as on me.

 I hereby represent and warrant that I am the sole copyright holder for the
Work and that I have the right and power to enter into this contract. I hereby
indemnify and hold harmless Cygnus, its officers, employees, and agents
against any and all claims, actions or damages (including attorney"s
reasonable fees) asserted by or paid to any party on account of a breach or
alleged breach of the foregoing warranty. I make no other express or implied
warranty (including without limitation, in this disclaimer of warranty, any
warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE).

Agreed:
