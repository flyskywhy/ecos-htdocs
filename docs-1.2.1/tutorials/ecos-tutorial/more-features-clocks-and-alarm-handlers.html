>If a program wanted to execute a task at a given time, or
periodically, it could do it in an inefficient way by sitting in
an infinite loop and checking the real-time clock to see if the
proper amount of time has elapsed. But operating systems usually
provide system calls which allow the program to be interrupted at
the desired time.</P

formalism, involving <I

>,
and <I

>. The precise definition, relationship,
and motivation of these features is beyond the scope of this tutorial,
but these examples illustrate how to set up basic periodic tasks.</P

CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Alarms</I

events that happen at a given time, either once or periodically.
A thread associates an alarm handling function with the alarm, so
that the function will be invoked every time the alarm &#8220;goes
off&#8221;.</P

>When running in a simulator the delays might be
quite long. On a hardware board (where the clock speed is 100 ticks/second)
the delays should average to about 0.3 seconds (and 2 seconds between
alarms). In simulation, the delay will depend on the speed of the
processor and will almost always be much slower than the actual
board. You might want to reduce the delay parameter when running
in simulation. </P

a counter handle. The program used the function <TT

CLASS="FUNCTION"
><B
>cyg_clock_to_counter()</B

strip the clock handle to the underlying counter handle. </P

><P
>Once the alarm is created it is initialized
with <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
><B
>cyg_alarm_initialize()</B

>, which sets the
time at which the alarm should go off, as well as the period for repeating
alarms. It is set to go off at the current time and then to repeat
every 200 ticks. </P

to the guidelines for writing alarm handlers and other <I

it does not invoke any functions which might lock the scheduler.
This is discussed in detail in the <I

Manual</I

CLASS="CITETITLE"

></LI
><LI
><P
>There is a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>critical region</I
> in
this program: the variable <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>how_many_alarms</I
></TT
> is accessed
in the main thread of control and is also modified in the alarm
handler. To prevent a possible (though unlikely) race condition
on this variable, access to <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>how_many_alarms</I
></TT

the principal thread is protected by calls to <TT

CLASS="FUNCTION"

When the scheduler is locked, the alarm handler will not be invoked,
so the problem is averted. </P
