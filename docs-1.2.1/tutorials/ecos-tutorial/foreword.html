>Welcome to the second public release of the Embedded Cygnus
Operating System,  <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
><SPAN
CLASS="TRADEMARK"
>eCos</SPAN
><SUP
><FONT
SIZE="-4"
>TM</FONT
></SUP
></SPAN
> version 1.2.1.</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> is an open source, configurable,
portable, and royalty-free embedded real-time operating system.
Let&#8217;s expand on these particular aspects further to give
you a clearer understanding of the vision behind <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
>.</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> is provided as an open source
runtime system supported by the Cygnus GNUPro open source development
tools. Developers have full and unfettered access to all aspects
of the runtime system. No parts of it are proprietary or hidden,
and you are at liberty to examine, add to, and modify the code as
you deem necessary. These rights are granted to you and protected
by the Cygnus <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> Public License (CEPL).
It also grants you the right to freely develop and distribute applications
based on <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
>. You are not expected or
required to make your embedded applications or any additional components
that you develop freely available, although we do ask that you make publicly
available any modifications to the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> code
itself. Cygnus of course welcomes all contributions back to <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> such
as board ports, device drivers and other components, as this helps
the growth and development of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
>, and
is a benefit to the entire <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> community.</P
><P
>One of the key technological innovations in <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> is
our configuration system. The configuration system allows the application
to impose its requirements on the run-time components, both in terms
of their functionality and implementation, whereas traditionally
the operating system has constrained the application&#8217;s
own implementation. Essentially, this enables <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> developers
to create their own application-specific operating system and makes
eCos suitable for a wide range of embedded uses. The configuration
system also presents <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> as a component architecture.
This provides a standardized mechanism for component suppliers to extend
the functionality of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> and will allow
applications to be built from a rich set of optional configurable
run-time components. These components are provided from a number
of different sources including: the standard <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> release;
commercial third party developers; open source contributors; or
additional optional components from Cygnus.</P
><P
>The royalty-free nature of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> means
that you can develop and deploy your application using the standard <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> release
without incurring any royalty charges. In addition, there are no
up-front license charges for the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> runtime
source code or <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> Sourceware tools.
We provide, without charge, everything necessary for basic embedded
applications development.</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> is designed to be portable
to a wide range of target architectures and target platforms including
16, 32, and 64 bit architectures, MPUs, MCUs and DSPs. The eCos
kernel, libraries and runtime components are layered on the Hardware Abstraction
Layer (HAL), and thus will run on any target once the HAL and relevant device
drivers have been ported to the targets processor architecture and
board. Currently eCos supports five different target architectures
and many variants of these architectures: </P

><P
>eCos has been designed to support applications with real-time
requirements, and therefore behaves in a deterministic manner and
includes all the necessary synchronization primitives, scheduling
policies, and interrupt handling mechanisms needed for real-time
applications. <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> also provides all
the functionality required for general embedded application support
including device drivers, memory management, exception handling,
C and math libraries, etc. In addition to runtime support, the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> system
includes all the tools necessary to develop embedded applications,
including <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> software configuration
and build tools, and GNUPro based compilers, assemblers, linkers,
debuggers, and simulators.</P
><P
>We have released <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> as Open Source
software because we believe that this is the most effective development
model for infrastructure software, and that it provides the greatest
benefit to the embedded developer community as a whole. As part
of this endeavor, we solicit input from, and the participation of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> developers
in making <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> a better product. This
participation can take many forms including: </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>providing us with feedback on how
eCos might be made more useful to you - by taking part in the ongoing
mailing list discussions and by submitting problem reports covering
bugs, documentation issues, and missing features</P

></LI

><P
>Our long-term aim is to make <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> a
rich and ubiquitous standard infrastructure for the development
of embedded applications. This will be achieved in part by Cygnus&#8217; own
efforts, but also with the assistance of the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> developer
community cooperating to improve <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> for
all.</P

>Cygnus provides a web site for all open source projects that
it sponsors, and this hosts an area dedicated to the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> developer
community <A
HREF="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos/</A
>The
site contains a rich set of resources including <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> news,
FAQ, online documentation, installation guide, runtime and development
tools downloads, discussion and announcement mailing lists, and
online problem report form. In the near future we will also be adding
AnonCVS and WEBCVS access to provide you with direct access to the
latest <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> updates. Complementing the
Sourceware site is an <SPAN

featuring news, press releases, details of Cygnus&#8217;s commercial engineering
and support services, products, and third party partner offerings.
