>If the hardware provides a periodic clock or timer, it will
be used to drive timing-related features of the system. Many CPU
architectures now have built in timer registers that can provide
a periodic interrupt. This should be used to drive these features
where possible. Otherwise an external timer/clock chip
must be used. </P
><P
>We draw a distinction between Counters, Clocks, Alarms and
Timers. A Counter maintains
a monotonically increasing counter that is driven by some source
of ticks. A Clock
is a counter driven by a regular source of ticks (i.e. it counts
time). Clocks have a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>resolution</I
> associated
with them. A default system Clock is driven by the periodic interrupt
described above, and tracks real-time. Other interrupt sources may
drive other Counters that may or may not track real-time at different
resolutions. Some Counters may be driven by aperiodic events and
thus have no relation to real-time at all. </P
><P
>An Alarm is
attached to a Counter and provides a mechanism for generating single-shot
or periodic events based on the counter"s value. A Timer
is simply an Alarm that is attached to a Clock. </P
><P
>The system (including the kernel) represents time in units
of <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>ticks</I
>. These are clock-specific time units
and are usually the period of the timer interrupt, or a multiple thereof.
Conversion of ticks into conventional time and date units should
occur only when required via library functions. Equivalence between
Clock time and real-time can be made with an RTC (real-time clock), NTP (network time protocol)
or user input. </P
><P
>The representation of the current tick count needs to be 64
bit. This requires either compiler support for 64 bit integers,
or assembly code. Even at the extreme of a 1 ns tick (ticks will
typically be &#62;1ms), this gives a 584 year rollover period. </P
><P
>The Clock API and configuration options that affect clock,
counter and alarm behavior are described in detail in <A
HREF="counters-clocks-and-alarms.html"
>the section called <I
>Counters, clocks
and alarms</I
> in Chapter 5</A
