<BR><H2>eCos Copyright Assignment Form</H2>
Revision 2.0
<HR noshade SIZE=3>

<P>This preamble describes how to use the standard eCos copyright assignment
form. The rationale behind this assignment is to avoid any possible confusion
over the legal ownership of eCos, and to indemnify the FSF and all eCos users
against copyright or patent claims on contributed code used within eCos.
The FSF would be especially vulnerable, but all users and their eCos based
applications could be affected.<p>

The contribution will remain freely available to all.<p>

This agreement gives the FSF ownership of your changes but promises that you will
retain the right to use your contributed changes as you see fit. Once this
form has been signed, if you wish you may also contribute future changes without
requiring a separate assignment form.<p>

Because employers often can claim ownership over things that employees write,
you may also have to get your employer to sign a disclaimer that says that
they have no claim to the changes you are contributing.<p>

Please read everything, and if you have any questions, email the
<a href="mailto:ecos-maintainers@sources.redhat.com">eCos
maintainers at
&lt;ecos-maintainers@sources.redhat.com&gt;</a> for help.<p>

Thanks for your contribution to eCos!<p>


The way to assign copyright to the FSF is to sign an assignment
contract. This is what makes the FSF the legal copyright holder
so that the FSF can register the copyright on the new version.<p>

If you are employed as a programmer (even at a university), or have made an
agreement with your employer or school that gives them ownership of the
software you write, then the FSF  needs a signed letter from your employer
disclaiming rights to the contributed software.<p>

The disclaimer should be printed on the company's headed paper, and signed
by an officer of the company, or someone authorized to license the company's
intellectual property.<p>

Here is an example of wording that can be used for this purpose. Much
of the disclaimer consists of a description of which kinds of work it
applies to.  This description is just a suggestion; your employer can
replace it with any description that says clearly which kinds of work
they want to disclaim and which kinds they don't.<p>

                 EMPLOYER DISCLAIMER OF RIGHTS

   We agree that software and other authored works of the 'Released
Category' (defined below), made by our employee/consultant,
_______________________, prior to the date of this document, and for
_____ years thereafter, are freely assignable by said
employee/consultant to Free Software Foundation (FSF) for distribution
and sharing under its free software policies.  We disclaim any status
as the author or owner of such works.

   The Released Category comprises

(a) changes and enhancements to software already (as of the time such
change or enhancement is made) freely circulating under stated terms
permitting public redistribution, whether in the public domain, or
under the FSF's GNU General Public License, or under the FSF's GNU
Library General Public License, or under other such terms; and

[(b) is optional.]
(b) operating system components for operating systems providing
substantially the same functionality as portions of UNIX, BSD
Microsoft Windows, or other popular operating systems.

The Released Category excludes ______________________ [if 'none',
please so state].

   We affirm that we will do nothing in the future to undermine this
release.  If we have or acquire hereafter any patent or interface
copyright or other intellectual property interest dominating the
works, or the programs to which these works constitute changes and
enhancements, or use of those programs, then the Free Software
Foundation and the general public will be permanently and irrevocably
licensed to use, in these works and in the programs they enhance,
without royalty or limitation, the subject matter of the dominating
interest.

   We make no warranty as to the quality of the material or as to
the presence or absence of rights therein of any other party, and we
do not purport to disclaim, release or grant any rights other than our
own.

   Given as a sealed instrument this ___ day of ______, 2003.    

             
 signed:___________________________,

        ___________________________ (title) of

        ___________________________ (company name),

If your employer says they do have an intellectual property claim that
could conflict with the use of the program, then please contact either
the eCos maintainers or the FSF to discuss possible next steps.<p>

Below is an assignment contract for your past and future changes to
eCos. You should insert your name where it says "Print your name:".<p>

Then print it out, sign it and date it.<p>

Mail the signed assignment to:<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard Stallman<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;545 Tech Sq rm 425<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cambridge, MA 02139<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;USA<br>

<p>
Don't forget to include the original signed copy of the employer's disclaimer.<p>

Please try to print the whole first page of the form on a single piece of
paper. If it doesn't fit on one printed page, put it on two sides of a single
piece of paper, and attach the second page of the form. Please write the date
using letters rather than numbers to avoid any confusion due to international
day/month ordering conventions.<p>

ASSIGNMENT OF COPYRIGHT IN REVISIONS OF eCos


For $1 and other good and valuable consideration received from Free
Software Foundation, a not-for-profit corporation of the state of
Massachusetts, hereinafter "FSF", the undersigned "Developer" does
hereby agree as follows:

1.(a) Developer hereby agrees to assign and does hereby assign to FSF
Developer's copyright in changes and/or enhancements to eCos (herein
called the Program).  These changes and/or enhancements are herein
called the Works.

(b) The assignment of par. 1(a) above applies to all past and future
works of Developer that constitute changes and enhancements to the
Program.

(c) For the purposes of this contract, a work "based on the Works"
means any work that in whole or in part incorporates or is derived
from all or part of the Works.

(d) FSF agrees to grant back to Developer, and does hereby grant,
non-exclusive, royalty-free and non-cancellable rights to use the
Works (i.e., Developer's changes and/or enhancements, not the Program
that they enhance), as Developer sees fit; this grant back does not
limit FSF's rights and public rights acquired through this agreement.

(e) FSF has all the rights of a copyright owner in the assigned
copyrights, subject to the license grantback to developer stated
above, including the right to enforce the copyright in aid of the free
software purposes of this agreement, and the right to use, license and
distribute the works, or works based on the works, with the program
enhanced thereby or as stand-alone modules, all as made or acquired by
developer or in modified form.  FSF may charge a fee of its choosing
for the service of distribution.

2. Developer will report occasionally, on its initiative and whenever
requested by FSF, the changes and/or enhancements which are covered by
this contract, and (to the extent known to Developer) any outstanding
rights, or claims of rights, of any person, that might be adverse to
the rights of Developer or FSF or to the purpose of this contract.

3.(a) The parties shall execute such documents and undertake such acts
as may be requested by the other to implement the letter and spirit of
this agreement and any conveyance stated herein, subject to a
limitation of reasonableness of such request with attention to cost
and time burdens imposed thereby.

(b) The undertakings in par. 3(a), above, are without prejudice to the
conveyances made through this assignment document.  The intention of
FSF and Developer is that this assignment document will be
supplemented rarely, if at all, by other documents.

4. FSF agrees that all distribution of the Works, or of any work
"based on the Works", or the Program as enhanced by the Works, that
takes place under the control of FSF or its agents or successors,
shall be on terms that explicitly and perpetually permit anyone
possessing a copy of the work to which the terms apply, and possessing
accurate notice of these terms, to redistribute copies of the work to
anyone on the same terms.  These terms shall not restrict which
members of the public copies may be distributed to.  These terms shall
not require a member of the public to pay any royalty to FSF or to
anyone else for any permitted use of the work they apply to, or to
communicate with FSF or its agents or assignees in any way either when
redistribution is performed or on any other occasion.

5. FSF agrees that any program "based on the Works" offered to the
public by FSF or its agents or assignees shall be offered in the form
of machine-readable source code, in addition to any other forms of
FSF's choosing.  However, FSF is free to choose at its convenience the
media of distribution for machine-readable source code and may charge
a fee of its choosing for copies.

6. Developer hereby agrees that if he has or acquires hereafter any
patent or interface copyright or other intellectual property interest
dominating the Works, the Program, the Program as enhanced by the
Works, or other enhancements to the Program, or the use of any of
those, such dominating interest will not be used to undermine the
effect of this assignment, i.e. the Foundation and the general public
will be licensed to use, in that program or programs and their
derivative works, without royalty or limitation, the subject matter of
the dominating interest.  This license provision will be binding on
the assignees of, or other successors to, the dominating interest, as
well as on Developer.  This license grant is nonexclusive,
royalty-free and non-cancellable.

7. (a) Developer warrants to FSF that his reports in accord with
section 2 above are accurate and that he is the sole copyright holder
of the Works conveyed either now or in the future under this
agreement.

(b) Developer agrees to hold FSF harmless from damage arising out of
any breach of this warranty---any adverse ownership interest not
reported by Developer and resulting in direct or indirect harm to FSF.
Developer's warranty and hold harmless obligation does not run to the
general public except insofar as damage to the public results in harm
to FSF.

(c) Developer is not obliged to defend FSF against any spurious claim
of adverse ownership, but will cooperate with FSF in defending against
any such claim and will indemnify FSF for all losses if the claim is
not spurious, i.e. if the adverse claimant is a true owner and FSF is
thereby damaged, including but not limited to the amount of all
adverse damage judgments and costs of litigation.

(d) Developer makes no other express or implied warranty (including
without limitation, in this disclaimer of warranty, any warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE).

8. This agreement and all conveyances made pursuant hereto are deemed
made in Massachusetts, this agreement and all such conveyances being
deemed made under seal, as of the date of fixation of any work covered
hereby in tangible form and, also, as of the date of execution of this
agreement by Developer.
