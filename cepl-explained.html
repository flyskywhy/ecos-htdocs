<h3>What does the Cygnus eCos Public License mean to the embedded 
    developer?</h3>

<p>Our primary concern in the creation of the 
<a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos/license.html">Cygnus eCos
Public License (CEPL)</a> is to the developer.  How do you structure
a license such that it enables free and open exchange of ideas
and also enables accelerated growth of a standard in the industry?

<p>If eCos is to become the RTOS standard for embedded devices, there
needs to be a license that removes intellectual property barriers,
removes business barriers, and enables innovation.  Cygnus looked at
many different licenses out in the market today and found that the 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/NPL/">Mozilla Public License</a> was a
great starting point.  

<p>In the beginning, eCos will be evolving at a very rapid pace, so it
is in the best interest of all early adopters of eCos to work together
to make eCos the most reliable and innovative technology for embedded
devices.  We feel that the best way to manage such rapid innovation
and contribution is to create a holding body that collects the changes,
passes these changes through quality assurance, and then releases the
improvements in source back to the software developer community for all
to benefit.  Cygnus is committed to acting in this capacity.  This is very
similar to how Cygnus' business is structured around the GNU development
tools today.  

<p>The Mozilla Public License contained many of the attributes we
needed, but did not take in to consideration the nature of the embedded
market.  Developers need to be free to create embedded applications
using the technology without compromising their strategic advantage in
the marketplace.  Cygnus structured the license such that it gave the
developers the ability to add hooks into the source of eCos for their
software, but only obligates them to make these hooks available back to
the public.  This does several things for a highly fragmented embedded
developer community:

<ol>

<li> Creates a channel for high value third party components to be 
     written to a single RTOS platform that is source open and freely 
     redistributable.

<li> Allows third parties to 'sell' components without compromising their 
     strategic advantage in the marketplace by having to release all 
     aspects of the source.

<li> Advances eCos to allow for expansion of third party software without 
     fighting the proprietary commercial RTOS vendors.

<li> Leverages the net contribution model for rapid innovation and expansion 
     of technology, while maintaining a single repository for tested source.

<li> Provides a catalyst to develop a strong basic infrastructure standard 
     for embedded development without having to give away proprietary 
     intellectual property.  That is to say, giving back modified 
     source is only necessary if the modifications are made to eCos.

</ol>

<p>Cygnus believes that the basic infrastructure for creating embedded
software should be free and open in order to enable rapid growth and
innovation.  We believe that the CEPL helps enable this goal and creates a
necessary balance between source open software for standard infrastructure
and high value commercial components that use that infrastructure.
However, we recognize and firmly believe that "High value proprietary
software today is tomorrow's infrastructure".


<h3>What does the Cygnus eCos Public License mean to the Manufacturer?</h3>

<p>Cygnus believes that if the license benefits the developer community,
it benefits the manufacturer.  If Cygnus is successful in enabling a
larger embedded developer marketplace, then rapid innovation flourishes
and the market provides more choice and opportunity for the manufacturer.
However, there are some aspects of the CEPL that specifically address
the concerns of the manufacturer.  Although eCos is based on the CEPL,
Cygnus also ensured that commercial manufacturers are free to provide
their solutions on top of, and including, eCos under the licensing terms
they deem appropriate for their product or business model.  The ability
for commercial manufacturers to enforce licensing terms to the solutions
that they create is requisite if eCos is to be an open standard for
the embedded marketplace.  Cygnus believes that there should not be
any portions of the eCos that are not part of the open infrastructure,
however, some vendors will continue to provide value-added components
that they wish to own and sell.  Cygnus, with our intention of making
eCos as broadly accepted standard as possible, provides licensing terms
that are flexible enough to accommodate this.
