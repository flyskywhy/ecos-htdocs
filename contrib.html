<h3>How to participate</h3>

<p> We welcome any contribution to eCos.  There are many levels at
which you can participate:

<ul>
  <li>You can participate in discussions, thus letting us know how
      eCos might be more useful to you.
  <li>You can <a href="problems.html">report bugs</a> in eCos.
  <li>You can send us a patch for a bug you find.
  <li>You can contribute a whole new piece of code, such as a device
      driver or a whole new package.
</ul>


<h3>Legal issues: assigning copyright</h3>

<p> If you will be submitting a large patch, or a significant body of
new code, you might consider assigning the copyright of that code to
Cygnus so that it can be distributed as part of the core eCos
component repository.

<p> Legal information about copyright assignment, as well as the form,
can be found <a
href="ecos-docs/tutorials/ecos-tutorial/the-ecos-copyright-assignment-form.html">
here </a>.

<p> If you do not assign copyright, we are still very interested in
putting your code in the contributed area of this site.

<p> If your contributed code is small, you can mail it to the
<email>ecos-discuss@cygnus.com</email> list.  If it is large, make it
available on the net and send a pointer to
<email>ecos-discuss@cygnus.com</email> and we will put it in the
contributed area ourselves.
