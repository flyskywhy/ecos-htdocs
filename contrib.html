<h3>Introduction</h3>
Contributions to eCos are always welcome. These may be in the form of
a new package, enhancements to an existing package or bug fixes. A contribution
may be from a individual or part of a collaborative project. Information
on how to contribute is contained within the eCos <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>.

<h3>External projects</h3>

The following external projects are known to the eCos maintainers. Sources are
provided <i>as is</i> and are not supported by Cygnus at this time.

<h4>TCP/IP stack</h4>

Tristan Gingold has ported RTEMS libnetworking to eCos. This includes a
FreeBSD-derived TCP/IP stack. The sources are available for download at:<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/ecos/contrib/io/tcpip/rtems/">
ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/ecos/contrib/io/tcpip/rtems/</a>

<h4>PC platform HAL</h4>

Patrick O'Grady has developed an eCos HAL for the PC platform. A GDB stub
is provided, allowing the developer to download applications to the target
PC via a serial port. The sources are available for download at:<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/ecos/contrib/hal/i386/">
ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/ecos/contrib/hal/i386/</a>

<h4>Synthetic Linux platform HAL</h4>

Chris Provenzano has developed the eCos i386/Linux synthetic target. This
is essentially a port of the eCos HAL to a Linux process and allows the
developer to run eCos applications under Linux as if they were
native Linux applications. The sources are included in the eCos net
distribution as of release 1.2.1.

<h4>Floating point hardware support</h4>

Sergei Organov is working on support for floating point hardware within eCos.
He is targeting the PowerPC processors initially. Sources are not yet available.

<h4>NEC V850 architecture HAL</h4>

Takayuki Wakabayashi has developed an eCos HAL for the NEC V850 architecture.
The port was developed using the NEC V850 simulator and has not as yet been
targetted at a specific hardware platform. The port is completely unsupported 
and has not been tested at Cygnus. The sources will be available shortly.

<h4>Motorola MPC8xxFADS platform HAL</h4>

Kevin Hester has developed an eCos HAL for the Motorola MPC8xx Family Application
Development System platform. The sources are included in the eCos net
distribution as of release 1.2.1.

<h4>Samsung SNDS platform HAL</h4>

Grant Edwards is working on a port to the Samsung KS32C5000 microcontroller
(ARM7TDMI core) and SNDS development hardware.
Sources are not yet available (estimated availability - January 2000).
