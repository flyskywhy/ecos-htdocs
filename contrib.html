<h1>Contributions</h1>

<HR noshade SIZE=3>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Contributions to eCos are always welcome. These may be in the form of
a new package, enhancements to an existing package or bug fixes. A contribution
may be from a individual or part of a collaborative project. Information
on how to contribute is contained within the eCos <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2>External projects</h2>

<p>The following external projects are known to the eCos maintainers. If you are
working on an eCos-based project that others could benefit from or contribute
to, please let the <a href="mailto:ecos-maintainers@redhat.com">eCos maintainers</a>
know and it will be added to this page. Sources are provided <i>as is</i> and are
not supported by Red Hat at this time.</p>

<h3>TCP/IP stack</h3>

<p>Tristan Gingold has ported RTEMS libnetworking to eCos. This includes a
FreeBSD-derived TCP/IP stack. The sources are available for download at:</p>

<p><a href="ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/ecos/contrib/io/tcpip/rtems/">
ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/ecos/contrib/io/tcpip/rtems/</a></p>

<p>Note that this contribution is not related to the <a href="tcpip/">eCos
TCP/IP stack</a>.</p>

<h3>PC platform HAL</h3>

<p>Patrick O'Grady has developed an eCos HAL for the PC platform. A GDB stub
is provided, allowing the developer to download applications to the target PC
via a serial port. The sources are included in the eCos net distribution as
of release 1.3.1.</p>

<h3>Synthetic Linux platform HAL</h3>

<p>Chris Provenzano has developed the eCos i386/Linux synthetic target. This
is essentially a port of the eCos HAL to a Linux process and allows the
developer to run eCos applications under Linux as if they were native Linux
applications. The sources are included in the eCos net distribution as of
release 1.2.1.</p>

<h3>Kaffe Java VM</h3>

<p>Ryouzaburou Suzuki has ported the Kaffe Java VM to eCos 1.3.1 on SH4. It is
available for download <a href="http://www.sinby.com/"> here</a>. Note that
it is covered by the GNU General Public License.</p>

<h3>Floating point hardware support</h3>

<p>Sergei Organov is working on support for floating point hardware within
eCos. He is targeting the PowerPC processors initially. Sources are not yet
available.</p>

<h3>NEC V850 architecture HAL</h3>

<p>Takayuki Wakabayashi has developed an eCos HAL for the NEC V850
architecture. The port was developed using the NEC V850 simulator and has not
as yet been targeted at a specific hardware platform. The port is completely
unsupported  and has not been tested at Red Hat. The sources will be
available shortly.</p>

<h3>Motorola MPC8xxFADS platform HAL</h3>

<p>Kevin Hester has developed an eCos HAL for the Motorola MPC8xx Family
Application Development System platform. The sources are included in the eCos
net distribution as of release 1.2.1.</p>

<h3>Samsung SNDS platform HAL</h3>

<p>Grant Edwards is working on a port to the Samsung KS32C5000
microcontroller (ARM7TDMI core) and SNDS development hardware. Sources are
not yet available (estimated availability - January 2000).</p>

<h3>ARM Integrator HAL and drivers</h3>

<p>Philippe Robin at <a href="http://www.arm.com/" target="_top">ARM</a
 has contributed a
port to the <a href="http://www.arm.com/sitearchitek/devtools.ns4/iwpList113/F025F4F0A97DB15D802569190038F93F?OpenDocument&style=Dev_Tools" target="_top">
ARM Integrator</a> platform. This port is available in tarred gzip format
<a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/contrib/hal/arm/integrator/ecos_integrator.tar.gz">here</a>.</p>

<p>It is supplied as-is and was made against anonymous CVS as of the beginning
of October 2000. It will inevitably require some merging to work against
current anonymous CVS sources. There are some more comments from Philippe
on the status as contributed in
<a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/contrib/hal/arm/integrator/readme.txt">this readme</a>.</p>

<p>When the port is finished, it will be integrated into the anonymous CVS
repository in due course.</p>

<h3>CarbonKernel RTOS simulator support</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.realiant.com/" target="_top">Realiant Systems</a> has
made available an eCos personality for the
<a href="http://www.carbonkernel.org/" target="_top">
CarbonKernel RTOS simulator</a>. CarbonKernel is an event-driven simulator
which mimics RTOS behaviour, allowing development and testing of embedded
software on a workstation. More details can be found at the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/carbonkernel/" target="_top">
CarbonKernel development site</a>.</p>

<h3>Bluetooth and WAP stack</h3>

<p><a href="mailto:andreas_k_se@yahoo.com">Andreas Karlsson </a> at
<a href="http://www.combitechsystems.com/" target="_top">Combitech Systems AB
</a> has made available a port of the <a href="http://www.axis.com/"
target="_top">Axis</a> Bluetooth stack. This was ported to develop an
embedded WAP server running on top of Bluetooth.</p>

<p>The source code is available AS-IS from
<a href="http://www.combitechsystems.com/" target="_top">Combitech's web site
</a>.</p>

<h3>x86 NE2000 ethernet driver</h3>

<p>Christian Plessl and Thomas Meyer have ported an Ne2000 driver from
<a href="http://www.openblt.org/" target="_top">OpenBLT</a> to eCos.
It is restricted to the x86 PC port only. The
<a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/contrib/devs/eth/ne2000/readme.txt">
README</a> contains details and instructions from Christian's
announcement to the ecos-discuss list. The
<a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/contrib/devs/eth/ne2000/ne2000.tgz">
driver package tarball</a> and 
<a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/contrib/devs/eth/ne2000/addto.ecos.db">
addto.ecos.db file</a> can be downloaded
