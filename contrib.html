<h1>Contributions and Development Projects</h1>

<HR noshade SIZE=3>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Contributions to eCos are always welcome. These may be in the form of
a new package, enhancements to an existing package or bug fixes. A contribution
may be from a individual or part of a collaborative project. Information
on how to contribute is contained within the eCos <a href="/fom-serv/ecos/cache/45.html">FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2>Development projects</h2>

<p>The eCos maintainers welcome proposals for new eCos packages and enhancements to
existing packages. If you have an idea for a new development, please talk
to us as early as possible. The best place to initiate a discussion of your proposal
is on the <a href="mailto:ecos-devel@ecos.sourceware.org">ecos-devel</a> mailing list.
If your proposal appears sound, we will add your project to the <a href="#registered">table</a> below.
By registering projects in this way, the possibility of duplicated effort is reduced,
the potential for community involvement is enhanced and the eCos maintainers are able
to offer guidance to help ensure that the final project deliverables will be acceptable.</p>

<p>As a matter of policy, contributions arising from registered projects will be
considered for acceptance into the eCos repository with priority over broadly
equivalent contributions developed in private. This policy is intended to encourage
collaboration on new features and reduce the possibility of a community development
being rejected in favour of a private development of similar scope and quality.</p>

<h2>Licensing of contributions</h2>

<p>Contributions to the eCos project should be licensed under the
<a href="license-overview.html">eCos License</a>.
It may also be possible to accept contributions containing third party
code from certain trusted sources and covered by more liberal licenses,
such as the BSD license. Please seek advice from the eCos maintainers in
such cases.</p>

<p>Please note that we are unable to accept contributions which contain code
licensed under the unmodified GNU General Public License (GPL) for incorporation
into the eCos repository.</p>

<h2>Copyright assignments</h2>

<p>Any significant contribution (typically greater than 10 lines of code) must be
accompanied by an assignment of copyright to the <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free
Software Foundation</a>. Details of this procedure are available on the
<a href="assign.html">eCos Copyright Assignment</a> page.</p>

<p>The rationale behind this policy is to avoid any possible confusion over
the legal ownership of eCos, and to ensure that the contributor's employer or academic
institution assents to the work being contributed. It also allows the copyright to
be vested centrally so that the eCos license may be enforced. Successful enforcement
of a software license is dependent on the cooperation of all copyright holders.</p>

<p> The eCos maintainers will advise contributors when a copyright assignment is
necessary. If your employer does not consent to the disclaimer, or you do not hold
copyright for all the contributed code, then a copyright assignment will not be
possible and the contribution will not be accepted into the eCos repository. However,
it may still be possible to list the contribution on this page.</p>

<h2>Other projects</h2>

<p>This section lists eCos-related developments which have either not been
contributed or not been accepted into the CVS repository for some reason.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<h4>MiniGUI</h4>

<p>Wei Yongming of <a href="http://www.minigui.com/">Feynman Software</a>
has released an eCos port of their lightweight cross-platform Graphics User
Interface support system named MiniGUI. It is available
under both the GPL and a
<a href="http://www.minigui.com/product/index.shtml">commercial license</a>.
More information can be found at the
<a href="http://www.minigui.com/">Feynman Software</a> site, as well as
the <a href="http://www.minigui.org/">home of the open source MiniGUI project</a>.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<h4>OpenSSL</h4>

<p>
Andrew Lunn of Ascom has made available a port of the
<a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> library. Due to export problems
this library is not available and unfortunately will not become available
from <tt>ecos.sourceware.org</tt>. Instead it is hosted at eCosCentric's FTP
server as this is based in the UK, not the US. The package is distributed in
EPK format and can be installed using the eCos package administration
tool. It is available by FTP from
<a href="ftp://ftp.ecoscentric.com/pub/contrib/openssl-1.9.6b.epk">
ftp://ftp.ecoscentric.com/pub/contrib/openssl-1.9.6b.epk</a>. Use shift-click
on this link to save the file - some browsers incorrectly treat this file
as text.</p>
<p>
Be aware of the legal status of using encryption libraries like OpenSSL.
The use of some encryption algorithms are patented in various
territories, especially the US. Similarly some territories control the
export of products containing encryption, again including the US.
</p>

<h4>EtherCAT master library for eCos</h4>

<p>
The Flanders Mechatronics Technology Centre - 
<a href="http://www.fmtc.be" target="_blank">FMTC</a> - 
has decided to release their 
<a href="http://www.ethercat.org" target="_blank">EtherCAT</a> master
implementation as open source software. The EtherCAT master library,
together with its technical documentation can be obtained from
<a href="http://ethercatmaster.berlios.de" target="_blank">
http://ethercatmaster.berlios.de</a>.  The software has been written
for and has been tested with the eCos operating system.

<a href="http://www.cetoni.de/develop/develop_ecosh8s_en.html"
target="_blank"> eCos to H8S microcontroller</a> architecture. The
port includes various variant and platform ports (i.e. for EDOSK2674)
and a number of drivers (i.e. Serial, Network, RTC...). cetoni
also hosts a prebuild h8300-elf toolchain for eCos (Cygwin only) and a
detailed
<a href="http://www.cetoni.de/develop/uploads/eCos_for_H8S.pdf" 
target="_self"> porting guide</a> for H8S variant and platform
ports.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<h4>3G LAB projects</h4>

<p>3G LAB were engaged in quite a number of projects that will enhance
eCos. Some of them, like ROM filesystem and iPAQ port have already
been incorporated into the development repository.  Other projects of
interest include:
<ul>
<li>ELF shared library loading and run-time linking (including lazy procedure linking at call time). 
<li>Memory protection for loaded libraries.
<li>Advanced memory allocation and virtual space management. 
<li>XIP (Execute in place) for ROMFS and RAMFS loaded applications. 
<li>User-id & group-id based permissions checking for file access. 
<li>ARM USER mode execution of shared library code, with SWI interfaces to the kernel. 
<li>Parameter checking for calls from user mode into the kernel. 
<li>Advanced stack checking for user applications that allow faulty applications to be terminated whilst leaving the rest of the system executing. 
<li>Partial POSIX process emulation, with pthread grouping and signal marshalling. 
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Microwindows port to Linux synthetic target and Assabet</h4>

<p><a href="mailto:ijsung@csie.nctu.edu.tw">I-Jui Sung</a> has done a
preliminary port of <a href="http://www.microwindows.org/">
Microwindows/Nano-X</a> to the Linux synthetic and Assabet targets. This port
differs from the iPAQ demo port in that it uses POSIX mqueues instead of
a loopback TCP/IP socket, which is more lightweight. The Linux port
comes with a framebuffer simulator for eCos that communicates with the
real desktop. Downloads are available
<a href="http://www.csie.nctu.edu.tw/~ijsung/MicroWin-eCos/">here</a>.</p>

done a <a href="http://www.microwindows.org/">Microwindows</a> port. This is
to x86 systems using a Trident VGA card. It also includes the PC mouse
support he wrote earlier that is mentioned separately below. A zip file
containing the complete microwindows sources he used, mouse driver, and
TVGA driver is available from
