<h1>Contributions and Third Party Projects</h1>

<HR noshade SIZE=3>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Contributions to eCos are always welcome. These may be in the form of
a new package, enhancements to an existing package or bug fixes. A contribution
may be from a individual or part of a collaborative project. Information
on how to contribute is contained within the eCos <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2>Third Party Projects</h2>

<p>The following external projects are known to the eCos maintainers. If you are
working on an eCos-based project that others could benefit from or contribute
to, please let the <a href="mailto:ecos-maintainers@redhat.com">eCos maintainers</a>
know and it will be added to this page. Sources are provided <i>as is</i> and are
not supported by Red Hat at this time.</p>

<h4>Single precision math library</h4>

<p><a href="mailto:luoqi@FreeBSD.org">luoqi</a> has ported FreeBSD's single
precision portion of the math library to eCos. The necessary code is available
to download <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/~luoqi/ecos">here</a>.</p>

<h4>3G LAB projects</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.3glab.com/">3G LAB</a> are engaged in quite a number of
projects that will enhance eCos. Some of them, like ROM filesystem and
iPAQ port have already been incorporated into the development repository.
Further projects are available from the
<a href="http://www.3glab.org/">eCos resources page at www.3glab.org</a>.</p>

<h4>Nano-X port to Linux synthetic target and Assabet</h4>

<p><a href="mailto:ijsung@csie.nctu.edu.tw">I-Jui Sung</a> has done a
preliminary port of <a href="http://www.microwindows.org/">
Nano-X / Microwindows</a> to the Linux synthetic and Assabet targets. This port
differs from the iPAQ demo port in that it uses POSIX mqueues instead of
a loopback TCP/IP socket, which is more lightweight. The Linux port
comes with a framebuffer simulator for eCos that communicates with the
real desktop. Downloads are available
<a href="http://www.csie.nctu.edu.tw/~ijsung/MicroWin-eCos/">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Port to Sony Playstation 2</h4>

<p><a href="mailto:t@keshi.org">Yaegashi Takeshi</a> has ported eCos and
RedBoot to the Sony PlayStation 2 based on the MIPS Emotion Engine. More
information is available at <a href="http://ps2hacking.sourceforge.net/">
http://ps2hacking.sourceforge.net/</a>.</p>

<h4>Port to Sega Dreamcast</h4>

<p><a href="mailto:t@keshi.org">Yaegashi Takeshi</a> has also ported eCos and
RedBoot to the Sega Dreamcast, based on the Hitachi SuperH. Information

<h4>eSoap for eCos</h4>

<p><a href="mailto:rdasilva@connecttel.com">Rosimildo daSilva</a> has
developed an embedded SOAP toolkit named eSoap that runs under eCos.
More details are available at <a href="http://www.embedding.net/eSOAP">
http://www.embedding.net/eSOAP</a>. eSoap is free for non-commercial
applications.</p>

<h4>x86 NE2000 ethernet driver</h4>

<p>Christian Plessl and Thomas Meyer have ported an Ne2000 driver from
<a href="http://www.openblt.org/" target="_top">OpenBLT</a> to eCos.
It is restricted to the x86 PC port only. The
<a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/contrib/devs/eth/ne2000/readme.txt">
README</a> contains details and instructions from Christian's
announcement to the ecos-discuss list. The
<a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/contrib/devs/eth/ne2000/ne2000.tgz">
driver package tarball</a> and 
<a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/contrib/devs/eth/ne2000/addto.ecos.db">
addto.ecos.db file</a> can be downloaded
<a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/contrib/devs/eth/ne2000/">
here</a>.

<h4>Kaffe Java VM</h4>

<p>Ryouzaburou Suzuki has ported the Kaffe Java VM to eCos 1.3.1 on SH4. It is
available for download <a href="http://www.sinby.com/"> here</a>. Note that
it is covered by the GNU General Public License.</p>

<h4>CarbonKernel RTOS simulator support</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.realiant.com/" target="_top">Realiant Systems</a> has
made available an eCos personality for the
<a href="http://www.carbonkernel.org/" target="_top">
CarbonKernel RTOS simulator</a>. CarbonKernel is an event-driven simulator
which mimics RTOS behaviour, allowing development and testing of embedded
software on a workstation. More details can be found at the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/carbonkernel/" target="_top">
CarbonKernel development site</a>.</p>

<h4>Bluetooth and WAP stack</h4>

<p><a href="mailto:andreas_k_se@yahoo.com">Andreas Karlsson </a> at
<a href="http://www.combitechsystems.com/" target="_top">Combitech Systems AB
</a> has made available a port of the <a href="http://www.axis.com/"
target="_top">Axis</a> Bluetooth stack. This was ported to develop an
embedded WAP server running on top of Bluetooth.</p>

<p>The source code is available AS-IS from
<a href="http://www.combitechsystems.com/node2866.asp" target="_top">Combitech's web site
</a>.</p>

<p>Note that this stack is covered by the GNU General Public License.</p>

<h4>TCP/IP stack</h4>

<p>Tristan Gingold has ported RTEMS libnetworking to eCos. This includes a
FreeBSD-derived TCP/IP stack. The sources are available for download
from ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/contrib/io/tcpip/rtems/</p>

<p>Note that this contribution is not related to the eCos
TCP/IP stack and may not be usable in the current release of eCos.</p>

<h2>Work in progress</h2>

<h4>Atmel AT91 EB01 port</h4>

<p>Carl van Schaik has made available an unsupported port to the Atmel
AT91M40400-based EB01 board. More information is available from 
<a href="/ml/ecos-discuss/2001-01/msg00496.html">this message to the
ecos-discuss list</a>.</p>

<h4>Floating point hardware support</h4>

<p>Sergei Organov is working on support for floating point hardware within
eCos. He is targeting the PowerPC processors initially. Sources are not yet
available.</p>

<h4>Samsung SNDS platform HAL</h4>

<p>Grant Edwards is working on a port to the Samsung KS32C5000
microcontroller (ARM7TDMI core) and SNDS development hardware. Sources are
not yet available (estimated availability - January 2000).</p>

<h4>ARM Integrator HAL and drivers</h4>

<p>Philippe Robin at <a href="http://www.arm.com/" target="_top">ARM</a>
 has contributed a
port to the <a href="http://www.arm.com/sitearchitek/devtools.ns4/iwpList113/F025F4F0A97DB15D802569190038F93F?OpenDocument&style=Dev_Tools" target="_top">
ARM Integrator</a> platform. This port is available in tarred gzip format
<a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/contrib/hal/arm/integrator/ecos_integrator.tar.gz">here</a>.</p>

<p>It is supplied as-is and was made against anonymous CVS as of the beginning
of October 2000. It will inevitably require some merging to work against
current anonymous CVS sources. There are some more comments from Philippe
on the status as contributed in
<a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/contrib/hal/arm/integrator/readme.txt">this readme</a>.</p>

<p>When the port is finished, it will be integrated into the anonymous CVS
repository in due course.</p>

<h2>Thanks to our contributors</h2>

<h4>PC platform HAL</h4>

<p>Patrick O'Grady developed the initial port of eCos for the PC platform. 
The sources are included in the eCos net distribution as
of release 1.3.1.</p>

<h4>Synthetic Linux platform HAL</h4>

<p>Chris Provenzano developed the eCos i386/Linux synthetic target. This
is essentially a port of the eCos HAL to a Linux process and allows the
developer to run eCos applications under Linux as if they were native Linux
applications. The sources are included in the eCos net distribution as of
release 1.2.1.</p>

<h4>Motorola MPC8xxFADS platform HAL</h4>

<p>Kevin Hester developed an eCos HAL for the Motorola MPC8xx Family
Application Development System platform. The sources are included in the eCos
net distribution as of release 1.2.1.</p>
