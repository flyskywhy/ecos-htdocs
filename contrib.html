<h3>How to participate</h3>

We welcome any patches and new code for eCos.

<h3>Legal issues: assigning copyright</h3>

<p> If you will be submitting a large patch, or a significant body of
new code, you should consider assigning the copyright of that code to
Cygnus so that it can be distributed as part of the core eCos
components.

<p> Legal information about copyright assignment, as well as the form,
can be found <a
href="ecos-docs/tutorials/ecos-tutorial/the-ecos-copyright-assignment-form.html">
here </a>.

<p> If you do not assign copyright, we are still very interested in
putting your code in the contributed area of this site.

<p> If your contributed code is small, you can mail it to the
<email>ecos-discuss@cygnus.com</email> list.  If it is large, make it
available on the net and send a pointer to
<email>ecos-discuss@cygnus.com</email> and we will put it in the
contributed area ourselves.
