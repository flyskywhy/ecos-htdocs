<h1>Contributions and Third Party Projects</h1>

<HR noshade SIZE=3>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Contributions to eCos are always welcome. These may be in the form of
a new package, enhancements to an existing package or bug fixes. A contribution
may be from a individual or part of a collaborative project. Information
on how to contribute is contained within the eCos <a href="/fom/ecos">FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2>Third party projects</h2>

<p>The following external projects are known to the eCos maintainers. If you are
working on an eCos-based project that others could benefit from or contribute
to, please let the <a href="mailto:ecos-maintainers@sources.redhat.com">eCos maintainers</a>
know and it will be added to this page. Sources are provided <i>as is</i> and are
not supported by Red Hat at this time.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<h4>OpenSSL</h4>

<p>
Andrew Lunn of Ascom has made available a port of the
<a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> library. Due to export problems
this library is not available and unfortunately will not become available
from <tt>ecos.sourceware.org</tt>. Instead it is hosted at eCosCentric's FTP
server as this is based in the UK, not the US. The package is distributed in
EPK format and can be installed using the eCos package administration
tool. It is available by FTP from
<a href="ftp://ftp.ecoscentric.com/pub/contrib/openssl-1.9.6b.epk">
ftp://ftp.ecoscentric.com/pub/contrib/openssl-1.9.6b.epk</a>. Use shift-click
on this link to save the file - some browsers incorrectly treat this file
as text.</p>
<p>
Be aware of the legal status of using encryption libraries like OpenSSL.
The use of some encryption algorithms are patented in various
territories, especially the US. Similarly some territories control the
export of products containing encryption, again including the US.
</p>
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<h4>SOWOS</h4>

<p>
<a href="http://www.thesoftwareobjects.com/">Software Objects Inc.</a> is
hosting a <a href="http://www.thesoftwareobjects.com/Projects">wireless open
source operating system named SOWOS</a>. This will be based on eCos and will
include Java support.
</p>
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<h4>LUA language support and FAT16</h4>

<p>
<a href="http://www.elatec.si/">Elatec engineering</a> has developed an
eCos port for the LUA 5.0 programming language. They are also developing
a FAT16 filesystem. Both these projects are available from
<a href="http://www.elatec.si/devel.html">http://www.elatec.si/devel.html</a>.
</p>
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<h4>Port to Game Boy Advance</h4>

<p>
<a href="http://www.charmedlabs.com/">Charmed Labs</a> has developed the
<a href="http://www.charmedlabs.com/ecosmain.htm">Xport</a> which turns
the Nintendo Game Boy Advance into an embedded devleopment
system, complete with <a href="http://www.charmedlabs.com/ecos.htm">
eCos and RedBoot port</a>.</p>

<p>Technical details and ordering information are available from
<a href="http://www.charmedlabs.com/">Charmed Labs</a>. The port should be
integrated into the anonymous CVS repository source tree shortly.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<h4>Port to easyCAN3 ARM CPU</h4>

<a href="http://www.europe-technologies.com/">Europe Technologies</a> has
provided a port to their
<a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/contrib/hal/arm/evmcan/easycan3.pdf">
easyCAN3</a> ARM-based microcontroller and in particular the
<a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/contrib/hal/arm/evmcan/evmcan.pdf">
EVM-CAN low-cost high performance development platform</a>. This is available
via FTP for
<a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/contrib/hal/arm/EVMCAN_packages.zip">
download as a complete source repository snapshot</a>. The sources will
be integrated into the eCos development repository shortly.
</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<h4>Single precision math library and termios non-canonical mode</h4>

<p><a href="mailto:luoqi@FreeBSD.org">luoqi</a> has ported FreeBSD's single
precision portion of the math library to eCos. Luoqi has also added support
for non-canonical mode in the existing termios support. The necessary patches
are available to download
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/~luoqi/ecos">here</a>.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<h4>3G LAB projects</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.3glab.com/">3G LAB</a> are engaged in quite a number of
projects that will enhance eCos. Some of them, like ROM filesystem and
iPAQ port have already been incorporated into the development repository.
Other projects of interest include:
<ul>
<li>ELF shared library loading and run-time linking (including lazy procedure linking at call time). 
<li>Memory protection for loaded libraries.
<li>Advanced memory allocation and virtual space management. 
<li>XIP (Execute in place) for ROMFS and RAMFS loaded applications. 
<li>User-id & group-id based permissions checking for file access. 
<li>ARM USER mode execution of shared library code, with SWI interfaces to the kernel. 
<li>Parameter checking for calls from user mode into the kernel. 
<li>Advanced stack checking for user applications that allow faulty applications to be terminated whilst leaving the rest of the system executing. 
<li>Partial POSIX process emulation, with pthread grouping and signal marshalling. 
</ul>
Further projects are available from the
<a href="http://www.3glab.org/">eCos resources page at www.3glab.org</a>.</p>

<h4>Microwindows port to Linux synthetic target and Assabet</h4>

<p><a href="mailto:ijsung@csie.nctu.edu.tw">I-Jui Sung</a> has done a
preliminary port of <a href="http://www.microwindows.org/">
Microwindows/Nano-X</a> to the Linux synthetic and Assabet targets. This port
differs from the iPAQ demo port in that it uses POSIX mqueues instead of
a loopback TCP/IP socket, which is more lightweight. The Linux port
comes with a framebuffer simulator for eCos that communicates with the
real desktop. Downloads are available
<a href="http://www.csie.nctu.edu.tw/~ijsung/MicroWin-eCos/">here</a>.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<h4>Microwindows port to x86 target and Trident VGA card</h4>

<p><a href="mailto:lhbyron@yahoo.com">Li Hui</a> has also separately
done a <a href="http://www.microwindows.org/">Microwindows</a> port. This is
to x86 systems using a Trident VGA card. It also includes the PC mouse
support he wrote earlier that is mentioned separately below. A zip file
containing the complete microwindows sources he used, mouse driver, and
TVGA driver is available from
