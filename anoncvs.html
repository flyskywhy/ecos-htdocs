<H2>Anonymous CVS Access</H2>
<HR SIZE=3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
The most recent versions of eCos may be obtained using anonymous CVS access.
This facility provides immediate access to the <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/ecos/packages/NEWS?content-type=text/plain&cvsroot=ecos">latest eCos
features</a> and the rapid deployment of any necessary bug fixes. 

<P>
For those unfamiliar with CVS, the following resources may be of use:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/">Cyclic Software</A> has CVS clients
available for download. <A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/info.html">Other
information</A> and links to books on the subject can also be found at their site.
<LI>Cyclic provides a fairly simple guide, the
<A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/doc-blandy.html">Introduction to CVS</A>
by Jim Blandy.
<LI>The CVS sources come with <i>texinfo</i> documentation which is also
available in <A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_toc.html">
HTML format</A>.
</UL>
We also provide a simple but effective way to
<A HREF="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/ecos/packages/?cvsroot=ecos">view the eCos CVS repository</a>
over the web using CVSweb. You can inspect the contents, history and
differences between versions of all files in the repository in this way.
<P>
<h3>The eCos repository</h3>
<P>
The eCos anonymous CVS repository contains the latest version of our master
internal repository and is generally updated on a weekly basis. However,
users should note that these updates have not been rigorously tested and
cannot be guaranteed to build or function correctly. It is therefore
recommended that new developers work with the latest full release of eCos
which has been put through extensive testing and QA. The repository should be
used in situations where you need access to new features, bug fixes, or are
working on a shared contributed project.
<P>
The snapshots include as much source code for the target side as we are able to
publicise. They do <i>not</i> include our documentation sources, nor
the source code to the host tools. There may also be new architectural ports,
board ports, or areas of functionality which are not released for commercial
or contractual reasons.
<P>
The relevant host side build tools may be obtained by FTP from this site and are not provided by anonymous CVS.
Any patches or changes required to enable the use of these tools
with the latest version of eCos in the repository will be publicised.
If any updates to the eCos Configuration Tool are required, we
will put up a new binary as soon as possible. You should ensure that you use the latest version of
the Configuration Tool from the most recent net release of eCos when
working with the sources from the anonymous CVS repository.

<h3>Accessing the repository</h3>
<P>
Before you can access the CVS repository, you must have a CVS client (see
above) and direct TCP/IP access. If you are behind a firewall, you should
discuss access with your local systems administrator.
<P>
Type the following command to login to the CVS server:
<PRE>
      cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.cygnus.com:/cvs/ecos login
</PRE>
<P>
You will be prompted for a password which is <i>anoncvs</i>. You only need to
perform this login the first time you access the eCos CVS repository.
The password is saved in the file <tt>.cvspass</tt> in your home
directory for use in subsequent sessions.
<P>
Change to the directory where you want to check out eCos and type:
<PRE>
     cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.cygnus.com:/cvs/ecos -z 9 co -P ecos
</PRE>
<P>
This command should initiate a connection to the CVS server and check
out the latest
version of eCos. In the future, when you want to update your repository to
the latest version, go to the base of the repository tree and use the command:
<PRE>
     cvs -z 9 update -d -P
</PRE>

<h3>Using the repository</h3>
<P>
Once the sources have been checked out, Unix users (or Windows users using
the command line) can work as if the checked out repository was their normal eCos
repository. Users of the eCos Configuration Tool should select the new repository using the <i>Build->Repository</i> menu item.
<P>
Use of a new repository with an old build tree is not recommended.
Changes may have been made to the repository <i>pkgconf</I> files that will not be
present in the working versions in your build tree.
<P>
<h3>Release tags</h3>
<P>
Our public releases have all been tagged in the repository so that you can
check out the official release of any particular version. More usefully,
these tags can be used to view the differences between e.g. the last officially
released version and the latest version in the repository:
<PRE>
     cvs diff -r ecos-v1_1-release ecos/packages/targets
</PRE>
<P>
The release tags all take the form <CODE>ecos-&lt;version&gt;-release</CODE> (eg <CODE>ecos-v1_2_1-release</CODE>). The repository
is also tagged every time a new snapshot is generated. These tags are of the
form <CODE>ecos-sw-&lt;date in ISO format&gt;</CODE> (eg <CODE>ecos-sw-1999-05-11</CODE>).
<P>
To check out a particular version from scratch, use a command such as:
<PRE>
     cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.cygnus.com:/cvs/ecos co -r ecos-v1_2_1-release ecos
</PRE>
<P>
As with all such <i>sticky</I> checkouts, a cvs
update will <i>not</i> update your sources to the latest version.
<P>
<h3>eCos Configuration Tool</h3>
<P>
The current set of sources in the CVS repository requires an updated version
of the eCos Configuration Tool for Windows. You can
<A HREF="ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/ecos/anoncvs/Configtool129.exe">download</a>
the new version as a self-extracting zip file. It is
recommended that you rename the existing file <CODE>Configtool.exe</CODE> to
<CODE>Configtool.exe.old</CODE> before proceeding.
<P>
Install the revised configuration tool by executing the downloaded file.
Modify the suggested target folder as necessary to place the extracted files in the
<CODE>tools/bin</CODE> directory of your eCos installation. Before using
the new tool with an existing eCos 1.2.1 installation, registry keys
describing the target platforms must be added. Double click on the
extracted file <code>Platforms121.reg</code> in the <code>tools/bin</code>
directory to set up the registry appropriately.
<P>
<h3>Other notes</h3>
<P>
Anonymous CVS access to the repository is read-only. If
you would like to contribute a change, bug fix or other improvement
to eCos then you should start by discussing it on the 
<A HREF="intouch.html">
ecos-discuss</A> mailing list. If applicable, you may wish to post
(or put up for FTP) the relevant diff or patch.
<P>
You can obtain e-mail notifications when changes are made to
the eCos repository. Refer to our <A HREF="intouch.html">keeping in touch</a> page for further details.
<p>
Since the anonymous CVS repository is copied from the master
repository, the author field and log entries are not accurate.
Use the ChangeLog files at the top of each package
hierarchy to obtain history on the sources in that package.
<P>
We are not generating any FTP snapshots currently - anonymous CVS access
is superior. However, please tell us if you think FTP access would be useful.
<P>
<a href="docs-latest/">Updated documentation</a> is available, covering
changes to eCos since the last official public release. Users of the
anonymous CVS sources should refer to the updated documentation.
<P>
Queries and problems regarding use of the anonymous CVS service should
be directed to the <A HREF="intouch.html">
ecos-discuss</A> mailing list. The eCos development team,
including the anonymous CVS maintainer, read this list. Please clarify
that the mail concerns an anonymous CVS problem in the subject field.
