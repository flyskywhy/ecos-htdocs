<H2>Anonymous CVS Access</H2>
<HR SIZE=3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
The most recent versions of eCos may be obtained using anonymous CVS access.
This facility provides immediate access to the <a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/ecos/packages/NEWS?content-type=text/plain&cvsroot=ecos">latest eCos
features</a> and the rapid deployment of any necessary bug fixes. 

<P>
For those unfamiliar with CVS, the following resources may be of use:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVShome.org</A> has CVS clients
available for download. Other
information and links to books on the subject can also be found at this site.
<LI>A good starting point is the
<A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/blandy.html">Introduction to CVS</A>
by Jim Blandy.
<LI>The CVS sources come with <i>texinfo</i> documentation which is also
available in <A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_toc.html">
HTML format</A>.
</UL>
We also provide a simple but effective way to
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/?cvsroot=ecos">view the eCos CVS repository</a>
over the web using CVSweb. You can inspect the contents, history and
differences between versions of all files in the repository in this way.
<P>
<h3>The eCos repository</h3>
<P>
The eCos anonymous CVS repository contains the latest version of our master
internal repository and is generally updated on a weekly basis. However,
users should note that these updates have not been rigorously tested and
cannot be guaranteed to build or function correctly. It is therefore
recommended that new developers work with the latest full release of eCos
which has been put through extensive testing and QA. The repository should be
used in situations where you need access to new features, bug fixes, or are
working on a shared contributed project.
<P>
The snapshots include as much source code as we are able to
publicize. However, there may be new architectural ports,
board ports, or areas of functionality which are not released for commercial
or contractual reasons.
<P>
The relevant host side build tools may be obtained by FTP from this site and are not provided by anonymous CVS.
Any patches or changes required to enable the use of these tools
with the latest version of eCos in the repository will be publicized.
If any updates to the eCos Configuration Tool are required, we
will put up a new binary as soon as possible. You should ensure that you use the latest version of
the Configuration Tool from the most recent net release of eCos when
working with the sources from the anonymous CVS repository.

<h3>Accessing the repository</h3>
<P>
Before you can access the CVS repository, you must have a CVS client (see
above) and direct TCP/IP access. If you are behind a firewall, you should
discuss access with your local systems administrator.
<P>
Type the following command to login to the CVS server:
<PRE>
      cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@sources.redhat.com:/cvs/ecos login
</PRE>
<P>
You will be prompted for a password which is <i>anoncvs</i>. You only need to
perform this login the first time you access the eCos CVS repository.
The password is saved in the file <tt>.cvspass</tt> in your home
directory for use in subsequent sessions.
<P>
It is recommended that you use different directory trees for the
anonymous CVS sources and for full releases of eCos. Create a new
directory for the check out, change to that directory, and type:
<PRE>
     cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@sources.redhat.com:/cvs/ecos -z 9 co -P ecos
</PRE>
<P>
This command should initiate a connection to the CVS server and check
out the latest
version of eCos. In the future, when you want to update your repository to
the latest version, go to the base of the repository tree and use the command:
<PRE>
     cvs -z 9 update -d -P
</PRE>

<h3>Using the repository</h3>

Once the sources have been checked out, Unix users (or Windows users using
the command line) can switch to it by setting the <tt>ECOS_REPOSITORY</tt>
environment variable to the <tt>ecos/packages</tt> subdirectory of the
checked out tree. For example:<p>

<nobr>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ECOS_REPOSITORY=/ecoscvs/ecos/packages ; export ECOS_REPOSITORY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>(for <i>sh</i>, <i>ksh</i> and <i>bash</i> users)<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setenv ECOS_REPOSITORY /ecoscvs/ecos/packages&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>(for <i>csh</i> and <i>tcsh</i> users)
</nobr>
<p>

Users of the eCos Configuration Tool should select the new repository using
the Build->Repository menu item.<p>

Use of a new repository with an old build tree is not recommended. Changes
may have been made to the repository CDL files that will not be present in
the working versions in your build tree. 

<h3>Optional networking support</h3>
<P>
Networking support is an optional feature in eCos and is not
checked out from the repository by default. The 1.3.1 EPKs are <b>not</b>
compatible with the code in the anonymous CVS repository. Such support
can be added to
an already checked out tree by executing the following command:
<PRE>
     cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@sources.redhat.com:/cvs/ecos -z 9 co -P net
</PRE>
<P>
A port of the University of California at Davis (UCD) SNMP stack is also
available as a separate optional package, and may be checked out by
additionally executing the following command:
<PRE>
     cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@sources.redhat.com:/cvs/ecos -z 9 co -P snmp
</PRE>
<P>
Note that the networking and SNMP package records will be present in the package
database (<tt>ecos.db</tt>) regardless of whether networking or SNMP support
is checked out. Updated configuration tools (see below) are
required when the networking/SNMP support is not present. The
eCos 1.3.1 tools will report errors.

<h3>Release tags</h3>
<P>
Our public releases have all been tagged in the repository so that you can
check out the official release of any particular version. More usefully,
these tags can be used to view the differences between e.g. the last officially
released version and the latest version in the repository:
<PRE>
     cvs diff -r ecos-v1_1-release ecos/packages/targets
</PRE>
<P>
The release tags all take the form <CODE>ecos-&lt;version&gt;-release</CODE> (eg <CODE>ecos-v1_3_1-release</CODE>). The repository
is also tagged every time a new snapshot is generated. These tags are of the
form <CODE>ecos-sw-&lt;date in ISO format&gt;</CODE> (eg <CODE>ecos-sw-1999-05-11</CODE>).
<P>
To check out a particular version from scratch, use a command such as:
<PRE>
     cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@sources.redhat.com:/cvs/ecos co -r ecos-v1_3_1-release ecos
</PRE>
<P>
As with all such <i>sticky</I> checkouts, a cvs
update will <i>not</i> update your sources to the latest version.
<P>

<A name="host-tools"></a><h3>Host configuration tools</h3>
<P>
The current set of sources in the CVS repository require an updated version
of the host-side configuration tools. You may wish to recompile these
yourself using the host tool sources available from anonymous CVS.
Alternatively, unsupported prebuilt binaries are available for Windows
and Red Hat Linux 6.x hosts.
<P>
<h4>Updated configuration tools for Windows</h4>
<p>
Self-extracting zip files for updated binaries of both the
<A HREF="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/anoncvs/Configtool1312.exe">
eCos Configuration Tool for Windows</A> and the
<A HREF="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/anoncvs/ecosconfig1312.exe">
command-line <tt>ecosconfig</tt> tool</A> are available.
<p>
It is recommended that you rename the existing files <tt>Configtool.exe</tt>
and <tt>ecosconfig.exe</tt> to <tt>Configtool.exe.old</tt> and
<tt>ecosconfig.exe.old</tt> before proceeding. These files are found in
the <tt>tools/bin</tt> subdirectory of your eCos installation.
<P>
Install the revised configuration tools by executing the downloaded files.
Modify the suggested target folder as necessary to place the extracted files
in the <CODE>tools/bin</CODE> directory of your eCos installation.
<P>

<h4>Updated configuration tools for Red Hat Linux 6.x and 7</h4>
<P>
An unsupported prebuilt binary of the updated <tt>ecosconfig</tt> tool for
Red Hat Linux 6.x and above is
<A HREF="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/anoncvs/ecosconfig1312-linux.gz">
available for download</a>.
<P>
It is recommended that you rename the existing <tt>ecosconfig</tt>
executable to <tt>ecosconfig.old</tt> before proceeding. This file is
located in the <tt>tools/bin</tt> subdirectory of your eCos installation.
<P>
Uncompress the updated tool with the commands: <p><tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gzip -N -d ecosconfig1312-linux.gz<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chmod +x ecosconfig
</tt><p>
Move the resulting <tt>ecosconfig</tt> executable into the <tt>tools/bin</tt>
subdirectory of your eCos installation.
<p>

<h3>Other notes</h3>
<P>
Anonymous CVS access to the repository is read-only. If
you would like to contribute a change, bug fix or other improvement
to eCos then you should start by discussing it on the 
<A HREF="intouch.html">
ecos-discuss</A> mailing list. If applicable, you may wish to post
(or put up for FTP) the relevant diff or patch.
<P>
You can obtain e-mail notifications when changes are made to the eCos
repository. Refer to our <A HREF="intouch.html">keeping in touch</a>
page for further details.
<p>
Since the anonymous CVS repository is copied from the master
repository, the author field and log entries are not accurate.
Use the ChangeLog files at the top of each package
hierarchy to obtain history on the sources in that package.
<P>
David Airlie of Parthus Technologies plc. has <A
HREF="../ml/ecos-discuss/2000-07/msg00070.html">announced</A> the
availability of FTP snapshots. It is possible to obtain <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.skynet.ie/cvs/">complete snaphosts</A> and <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.skynet.ie/cvs/ecos/">individual files</A>. This
service may be particularly useful for people unable to run CVS
directly, for example because of corporate firewalls.
<P>
<!--
<a href="docs-latest/">Updated documentation</a> is available, covering
changes to eCos since the last official public release. Users of the
anonymous CVS sources should refer to the updated documentation.
