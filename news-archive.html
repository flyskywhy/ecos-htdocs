<p>
Red Hat are pleased to announce an alpha release of the <a href="ct2.html">
eCos Configuration Tool version 2.0</a>.
</p>
<p>
This is a cross-platform version built using the
<a href="http://www.wxwindows.org"> wxWindows toolkit</a>. The 
tool uses the GTK+ widget set on Linux, and the WIN32 API on Windows 9x,
Windows NT and Windows 2000. It is similar to the MFC, Windows-only version 
but at present lacks a few of its features, such as the Memory Layout Tool
and the ability to run tests from within the tool.
