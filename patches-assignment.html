<BR><H2>Assigning copyright</H2>
Revision 1.0
<HR noshade SIZE=3>

<p>Any patch greater than a few lines (around 10 as a general rule)
needs to be accompanied by an assignment of copyright to <!-- the FSF
--> Red Hat.

<p>The rationale behind this assignment is to avoid any
possible confusion over the legal ownership of eCos, and to ensure
that the contributor's employer assents to the work being
contributed. It also allows the the copyright to be vested centrally
so that eCos's license may be enforced - something which only
copyright holders may do. If there are multiple authors of a
copyrighted work, successful enforcement depends on having the
cooperation of all authors.</p>

<p>Generally two documents are required to be posted to Red Hat. One
is the copyright assignment itself, and the other is a disclaimer of any
work-for-hire ownership claims by the contributor's employer - many
employment contracts include clauses that automatically assign all work
by employees to the employer.</p>

<p>The maintainers will let you know if they think an assignment is
necessary. If it is, then go to <a href="assign.html">the eCos
assignments page</a> and follow the instructions there. Once you have
one assignment, you are covered for all future patches, so you only
need to do this once.</p>

<p>If an assignment is needed it is best to get the process moving
as soon as possible; Red Hat may take a while to process
it. It is probably best to send the assignment forms off as soon as
you know what new or changed files the patch incorporates. The maintainers
will be notified independently when the assignment has been
processed. Patches will not be applied to the development repository
until Red Hat confirms the assignment.</p>

<p>If your employer does not consent to the disclaimer, or you do not hold
copyright for all the contributed code, then a copyright assignment is not
possible. In that case, provided the license for the code permits
redistribution (which may also required your employer's consent if
they are the copyright holder), it may be possible to place the
contribution on the <a href="contrib.html">contributions page</a>.</p>

<p>It may also be possible to include patches containing third party
code from certain established trusted sources and covered by certain
more liberal licenses, such as the BSD license. In such cases, please
ask the maintainers for advice as it may still be possible to include
the code. Alternatively the third party may be willing to make a
copyright assignment.</p>

<p>While fully GPL'd code is welcome to be placed on the
<a href="contrib.html">contributions page</a>, unfortunately it cannot be
included in the main eCos source base at this time to avoid the inadvertent
use of fully GPL'd code with eCos, i.e. not subject to the usual eCos
license exception clause. This is something that we hope to rectify at a
later date when tools are available to control the license of eCos packages.</p>
