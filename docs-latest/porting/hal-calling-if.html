<H2>eCos/ROM Monitor Calling Interface</H2>
<HR SIZE=3>

<p>Some eCos platforms have supported full debugging capabilities via
CygMon since day one. Platforms of the architectures PowerPC, ARM, and
SH do not provide those features unless a GDB stub is included in the
application.

<p>This is going to change. All platforms will (eventually) support
all the debugging features by relying on a ROM/RAM calling interface
(also referred to as virtual vector table) provided by the ROM
monitor. This calling interface is based on the tables used by libbsp
and is thus backwards compatible with the existing CygMon supported
platforms.

<h3>Virtual Vectors</h3>

<p>What are virtual vectors, what do they do, and why are they
needed?</p>

<p>"Virtual vectors" is the name of a table located at a static
location in the target address space. This table contains 64 vectors
that point to <em>service</em> functions or data.</p>

<p>The fact that the vectors are always placed at the same location in
the address space means that both ROM and RAM startup configurations
can access these and thus the services pointed to.</p>

<p>The primary goal is to allow services to be provided by ROM
configurations (ROM monitors in particular) with <em>clients</em> in
RAM configurations being able to use these services.</p>

<p>Without the table of pointers this would be impossible since the
ROM and RAM applications would be linked separately - in effect having
separate name spaces - preventing direct references from one to the
other.</p>

<p>This decoupling of service from client is needed by RedBoot,
allowing among other things debugging of applications which do not
contain debugging client code (stubs).</p>


<h4>Initialization (or Mechanism vs. Policy)</h4>

<p>Virtual vectors are a <em>mechanism</em> for decoupling services
from clients in the address space.</p>

<p>The mechanism allows services to be implemented by ROM monitor, RAM
application, to be switched out at run-time, to be disabled by
installing pointers to dummy functions, etc.</p>

<p>The appropriate use of the mechanism is specified loosely by a
<em>policy</em>. The general policy dictates that the vectors are
initialized in whole by ROM monitors (built for ROM or RAM), or by
stand-alone applications.</p>

<p>For configurations relying on a ROM monitor environment, the policy
is to allow initialization on a service by service basis. The default
is to initialize all services, except COMMS services since these are
presumed to already be carrying a communication session to the
debugger / console which was used for launching the application.  This
means that the bulk of the code gets tested in normal builds, and not
just once in a blue moon when building new stubs or a ROM
configuration.</p>

<p>The configuration options are written to comply with this policy by
default, but can be overridden by the user if desired. Defaults
are:</p>

<ul>
<li> <p>For application development: the ROM monitor provides
     debugging and diagnostic IO services, the RAM application relies
     on these by default.</p>

<li> <p>For production systems: the application contains all the
     necessary services.</p>
</ul>

<h4>Pros and Cons of Virtual Vectors</h4>

<p>There are pros and cons associated with the use of virtual
vectors. We do believe that the pros generally outweigh the cons by a
great margin, but there may be situations where the opposite is
true.</p>

<p>The use of the services are implemented by way of macros, meaning
that it is possible to circumvent the virtual vectors if
desired. There is (as yet) no implementation for doing this, but it is
possible.</p>

<p>Here is a list of pros and cons:</p>

<dl>
<dt><p>Pro: Allows debugging without including stubs</p></dt>

      <dd><p>This is the primary reason for using virtual vectors. It
          allows the ROM monitor to provide most of the debugging
          infrastructure, requiring only the application to provide
          hooks for asynchronous debugger interrupts and for accessing
          kernel thread information.</p></dd>

<dt><p>Pro: Allows debugging to be initiated from arbitrary
       channel</p></dt>

      <dd><p> While this is only true where the application does not
           actively override the debugging channel setup, it is a very
           nice feature during development. In particular it makes it
           possible to launch (and/or debug) applications via Ethernet
           even though the application configuration does not contain
           networking support.</p></dd>

<dt><p>Pro: Image smaller due to services being provided by ROM
       monitor</p></dt>

      <dd><p>All service functions except HAL IO are included in the
           default configuration. But if these are all disabled the
           image for download will be a little smaller. Probably
           doesn't matter much for regular development, but it is a
           worthwhile saving for the 20000 daily tests run in the Red
           Hat eCos test farm.</p></dd>

<dt><p>Con: The vectors add a layer of indirection, increasing application
       size and reducing performance.</p></dt>

      <dd><p>The size increase is a fraction of what is required to
           implement the services. So for RAM configurations there is
           a net saving, while for ROM configurations there is a small
           overhead.</p></dd>

      <dd><p>The performance loss means little for most of the
           services (of which the most commonly used is diagnostic IO
           which happens via polled routines anyway).</p></dd>

<dt><p>Con: The layer of indirection is another point of
       failure.</p></dt>

      <dd><p> The concern primarily being that of vectors being
           trashed by rogue writes from bad code, causing a complete
           loss of the service and possibly a crash.  But this does
           not differ much from a rogue write to anywhere else in the
           address space which could cause the same amount of
           mayhem. But it is arguably an additional point of failure
           for the service in question.</p></dd>

<dt><p>Con: All the indirection stuff makes it harder to bring a HAL
       up</p></dt>

      <dd><p> This is a valid concern. However, seeing as most of the
           code in question is shared between all HALs and should
           remain unchanged over time, the risk of it being broken
           when a new HAL is being worked on should be
           minimal.</p></dd>

      <dd><p> When starting a new port, be sure to implement the HAL
           IO drivers according to the scheme used in other drivers,
           and there should be no problem.</p></dd>

      <dd><p> However, it is still possible to circumvent the vectors
           if they are suspect of causing problems: simply change the
           HAL_DIAG_INIT and HAL_DIAG_WRITE_CHAR macros to use the raw
           IO functions.</p></dd>
</dl>

<h4>Available services</h4>

<p>The hal_if.h file in the common HAL defines the complete list of
available services. A few worth mentioning in particular:</p>

<ul>
<li> <p>COMMS services. All HAL IO happens via the communication
        channels.</p>
<li> <p>uS delay. Fine granularity (busy wait) delay function.</p>
<li> <p>Reset. Allows a software initiated reset of the board.</p>
</ul>


<h3>The COMMS channels</h3>

<p>As all HAL IO happens via the COMMS channels these deserve to be
described in a little more detail. In particular the controls of where
diagnostic output is routed and how it is treated to allow for display
in debuggers.</p>


<h4>Console and Debugging Channels</h4>

<p>There are two COMMS channels - one for console IO and one for
debugging IO. They can be individually configured to use any of the
actual IO ports (serial or Ethernet) available on the platform.</p>

<p>The console channel is used for any IO initiated by calling the
diag_*() functions. Note that these should only be used during
development for debugging, assertion and possibly tracing
messages. All proper IO should happen via proper devices. This means
it should be possible to remove the HAL device drivers from production
configurations where assertions are disabled.</p>

<p>The debugging channel is used for communication between the
debugger and the stub which remotely controls the target for the
debugger (the stub runs on the target). This usually happens via some
protocol, encoding commands and replies in some suitable form.</p>

<p>Having two separate channels allows, e.g., for simple logging
without conflicts with the debugger or interactive IO which some
debuggers do not allow.</p>


<h4>Mangling</h4>

<p>As debuggers usually have a protocol using specialized commands
when communicating with the stub on the target, sending out text as
raw ASCII from the target on the same channel will either result in
protocol errors (with loss of control over the target) or the text may
just be ignored as junk by the debugger.</p>

<p>To get around this, some debuggers have a special command for text
output. Mangling is the process of encoding diagnostic ASCII text
output in the form specified by the debugger protocol.</p>

<p>When it is necessary to use mangling, i.e. when writing console
output to the same port used for debugging, a mangler function is
installed on the console channel which mangles the text and passes it
on to the debugger channel.</p>


<h4>Controlling the Console Channel</h4>

<p>Console output configuration is either inherited from the ROM
monitor launching the application, or it is specified by the
application. This is controlled by the new option
CYGSEM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_INHERIT_CONSOLE which defaults to enabled
when the configuration is set to use a ROM monitor.</p>

<p>If the user wants to specify the console configuration in the
application image, there are two new options that are used for
this.</p>

<p>Defaults are to direct diagnostic output via a mangler to the
debugging channel (CYGDBG_HAL_DIAG_TO_DEBUG_CHAN enabled). The mangler
type is controlled by the option CYGSEM_HAL_DIAG_MANGLER. At present
there are only two mangler types:</p>

<dl>
<dt><p>GDB</p></dt>

  <dd><p> This causes a mangler appropriate for debugging with GDB to be
       installed on the console channel.</p></dd>

<dt><p>None</p></dt>

   <dd><p> This causes a NULL mangler to be installed on the console
        channel.  It will redirect the IO to/from the debug channel
        without mangling of the data. This option differs from setting
        the console channel to the same IO port as the debugging
        channel in that it will keep redirecting data to the debugging
        channel even if that is changed to some other port.</p></dd>

</dl>

<p>Finally, by disabling CYGDBG_HAL_DIAG_TO_DEBUG_CHAN, the diagnostic
output is directed in raw form to the specified console IO port.</p>

<p>In summary this results in the following common configuration
scenarios for RAM startup configurations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> For regular debugging with diagnostic output appearing in the
     debugger, mangling is enabled and stubs disabled.</p>

     <p>Diagnostic output appears via the debugging channel as
     initiated by the ROM monitor, allowing for correct behavior
     whether the application was launched via serial or Ethernet, from
     the RedBoot command line or from a debugger.</p>

<li><p> For debugging with raw diagnostic output, mangling is
     disabled.</p>

     <p> Debugging session continues as initiated by the ROM monitor,
     whether the application was launched via serial or
     Ethernet. Diagnostic output is directed at the IO port configured
     in the application configuration.</p>

     <p><b>Note:</b> There is one caveat to be aware of. If the
       application uses proper devices (be it serial or Ethernet) on
       the same ports as those used by the ROM monitor, the
       connections initiated by the ROM monitor will be
       terminated.</p>
</ul>

<p>And for ROM startup configurations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Production configuration with raw output and no debugging
     features (configured for RAM or ROM), mangling is disabled, no
     stubs are included.</p>

     <p>Diagnostic output appears (in unmangled form) on the specified
     IO port.</p>

<li><p> RedBoot configuration, includes debugging features and necessary
     mangling.</p>

     <p>Diagnostic and debugging output port is auto-selected by the
     first connection to any of the supported IO ports. Can change
     from interactive mode to debugging mode when a debugger is
     detected - when this happens a mangler will be installed as
     required.</p>

<li><p> GDB stubs configuration (obsoleted by RedBoot configuration),
     includes debugging features, mangling is hardwired to GDB
     protocol.</p>

     <p>Diagnostic and debugging output is hardwired to configured IO
     ports, mangling is hardwired.</p>
</ul>


<h4>Footnote: Design Reasoning for Control of Console Channel</h4>

<p>The current code for controlling of the console channel is a
replacement for an older implementation which had some shortcomings
addressed by the new implementation.</p>

<p>This is what the old implementation did: on initialization it would
check if the CDL configured console channel differed from the active
debug channel - and if so, set the console channel, thereby disabling
mangling.</p>

<p>The idea was that whatever channel was configured to be used for
console (i.e., diagnostic output) in the application was what should
be used. Also, it meant that if debug and console channels were
normally the same, a changed console channel would imply a request for
unmangled output.</p>

<p>But this prevented at least two things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> It was impossible to inherit the existing connection by which
     the application was launched (either by RedBoot commands via
     telnet, or by via a debugger).</p>

     <p>This was mostly a problem on targets supporting Ethernet
     access since the diagnostic output would not be returned via the
     Ethernet connection, but on the configured serial port.</p>

     <p>The problem also occurred on any targets with multiple serial
     ports where the ROM monitor was configured to use a different
     port than the CDL defaults.</p>

<li><p> Proper control of when to mangle or just write out raw ASCII
        text.</p>

     <p>Sometimes it's desirable to disable mangling, even if the
     channel specified is the same as that used for debugging. This
     usually happens if GDB is used to download the application, but
     direct interaction with the application on the same channel is
     desired (GDB protocol only allows output from the target, no
     input).</p>
</ul>

<h3>The calling interface API</h3>

<p>The calling interface API is defined by hal_if.h and hal_if.c in
hal/common.

<p>The API provides a set of services. Different platforms, or
different versions of the ROM monitor for a single platform, may
implement fewer or extra service. The table has room for growth, and
any entries which are not supported map to a NOP-service (when called
it returns 0 (false)).

<p>A client of a service should either be selected by configuration,
or have suitable fall back alternatives in case the feature is not
implemented by the ROM monitor.

<p><b>Note:</b>
Checking for unimplemented service when this may be a data
field/pointer instead of a function: suggest reserving the last entry
in the table as the NOP-service pointer. Then clients can compare a
service entry with this pointer to determine whether it's initialized
or not.

<p>hal_if.h: defines the table layout and accessor macros (allowing
 primitive type checking and alternative implementations should it
 become necessary).

<p>hal_if.c: defines the table initialization function (which all HALs
 should call during platform initialization - the table will get
 initialized according to configuration).
 Here is also defined wrapper functions which map between the calling
 interface API and the API of the used eCos functions.


<h4>Implemented Services</h4>

<p>This is a brief description of the services, some of which are
described in further detail below.</p>

<dl>
<dt><tt>VERSION</tt>
        <dd>Version of table. Serves as a way to check for how many
        features are available in the table. This is the index of the
        last service in the table.</dd>
<dt><tt>ICTRL_TABLE</tt>
        <dd>[Unused, possibly delete]</dd>
<dt><tt>EXC_TABLE</tt>
        <dd>[Unused, possibly delete]</dd>
<dt><tt>DBG_VECTOR</tt>
        <dd>ROM monitor entry point. Not supported at the moment.</dd>
<dt><tt>KILL_VECTOR</tt>
        <dd>[Presently unused by the stub code, but initialized] This
        vector defines a function to execute when the system receives
        a kill signal from the debugger. It is initialized with the
        reset function (see below), but the application (or eCos) can
        override it if necessary.</dd>
<dt><tt>CONSOLE_PROCS</tt>
        <dd>The communication procedure table used for console IO
        (see <a href="#io_channels">IO channels</a>).</dd>
<dt><tt>DEBUG_PROCS</tt>
        <dd>The communication procedure table used for debugger IO
        (see <a href="#io_channels">IO channels</a>).</dd>
<dt><tt>FLUSH_DCACHE</tt>
        <dd>Flushes the data cache for the specified
        region. Some implementations may flush the entire data cache.</dd>
<dt><tt>FLUSH_ICACHE</tt>
        <dd>Flushes (invalidates) the instruction cache
        for the specified region. Some implementations may flush the
        entire instruction cache.</dd>
<dt><tt>CPU_DATA</tt>
        <dd>[Presently unused] Architecture HAL may use this as a
        pointer to architecture specific data.</dd>
<dt><tt>BOARD_DATA</tt>
        <dd>[Presently unused] Platform HAL may use this as a
        pointer to platform specific data.</dd>
<dt><tt>SYSINFO</tt>
        <dd>[Presently unused] Could be used to return information
        about available memory, caches sizes, etc.</dd>
<dt><tt>SET_DEBUG_COMM</tt>
        <dd>Change debugging communication channel.</dd>
<dt><tt>SET_CONSOLE_COMM</tt>
        <dd>Change console communication channel.</dd>
<dt><tt>SET_SERIAL_BAUD</tt>
        <dd>[Unused, possibly delete. Feature available in comm table
        anyway]</dd>
<dt><tt>DBG_SYSCALL</tt>
        <dd>Vector used to communication between debugger functions in
        ROM and in RAM. RAM eCos configurations may install a function
        pointer here which the ROM monitor uses to get thread
        information from the kernel running in RAM.</dd>
<dt><tt>RESET</tt>
        <dd>Resets the board on call. If it is not possible to reset
        the board from software, it will jump to the ROM entry point
        which will perform a "software" reset of the board.</dd>
<dt><tt>CONSOLE_INTERRUPT_FLAG</tt>
        <dd>Set if a debugger interrupt request was detected while
        processing console IO. Allows the actual breakpoint action to
        be handled after return to RAM, ensuring proper backtraces
        etc.</dd>
<dt><tt>DELAY_US</tt>
        <dd>Will delay the specified number of microseconds. The
        precision is platform dependent to some extend - a small value
        (<100us) is likely to cause bigger delays than requested.</dd>
<dt><tt>INSTALL_BPT_FN</tt>
        <dd>Installs a breakpoint at the specified address. This is
        used by the asynchronous breakpoint support (see <a
        href="hal-stubs.html#async_bps">Asynchronous GDB
        breakpoints</a>).</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Compatibility</h4>

<p>When a platform is changed to support the calling interface,
applications will use it if so configured. That means that if an
application is run on a platform with an older ROM monitor, the
service is almost guaranteed to fail.

<p>For this reason, applications should only use Console Comm for HAL
diagnostics output if explicitly configured to do so
(CYGSEM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_DIAG).

<p>As for asynchronous GDB interrupts, the service will always be
used. This is likely to cause a crash under older ROM monitors, but
this crash may be caught by the debugger. The old workaround still
applies: if you need asynchronous breakpoints or thread debugging
under older ROM monitors, you may have to include the debugging
support when configuring eCos.

<h4>Implementation details</h4>

<p>During the startup of a ROM monitor, the calling table will be
initialized. This also happens if eCos is configured <em>not</em> to rely on
a ROM monitor.

<p><b>Note:</b> There is reserved space (256 bytes) for the vector
table whether it gets used or not. This may be something that we want
to change if we ever have to shave off every last byte for a given
target.

<p>If thread debugging features are enabled, the function for accessing
the thread information gets registered in the table during startup of
a RAM startup configuration.

<p>Further implementation details are described where the service itself
is described.</p>

<pre>
FIXME: Need to describe the CYGARC_HAL_SAVE_GP() and
CYGARC_HAL_RESTORE_GP() macros.
</pre>


<h4>New platform ports</h4>

<p>The hal_platform_init() function must call hal_if_init().

<p>The HAL serial driver must, when called via cyg_hal_plf_comms_init
initialize the communication channels.

<p>The reset() function defined in hal_if.c will attempt to do a hardware
reset, but if this fails it will fall back to simply jumping to the
reset entry-point. On most platforms the startup initialization will
go a long way to reset the target to a sane state (there will be
exceptions, of course). For this reason, make sure to define
HAL_STUB_PLATFORM_RESET_ENTRY in plf_stub.h.

<p>All debugging features must be in place in order for the debugging
services to be functional. See general platform porting notes.


<h4>New architecture ports</h4>

<p>There are no specific requirements for a new architecture port in
order to support the calling interface, but the basic debugging
features must be in place. See general architecture porting notes.

<p><HR SIZE=3>
<h3><a name="io_channels">IO channels</a></h3>


<p>The calling interface provides procedure tables for all IO channels on
the platform. These are used for console (diagnostic) and debugger IO,
allowing a ROM monitor to provided all the needed IO routines. At
the same time, this makes it easy to switch console/debugger channels
at run-time (the old implementation had hardwired drivers for console
and debugger IO, preventing these to change at run-time).

<p>The hal_if provides wrappers which interface these services to the
eCos infrastructure diagnostics routines. This is done in a way which
ensures proper string mangling of the diagnostics output when required
(e.g. O-packetization when using a GDB compatible ROM monitor).

<h4>Available Procedures</h4>

<p>This is a brief description of the procedures</p>

<dl>
<dt><tt>CH_DATA</tt>
<dd>Pointer to the controller IO base (or a pointer to a per-device
    structure if more data than the IO base is required). All the
    procedures below are called with this data item as the first
    argument.</dd>

<dt><tt>WRITE</tt>
        <dd>Writes the buffer to the device.</dd>
<dt><tt>READ</tt>
        <dd>Fills a buffer from the device.</dd>
<dt><tt>PUTC</tt>
        <dd>Write a character to the device.</dd>
<dt><tt>GETC</tt>
        <dd>Read a character from the device.</dd>
<dt><tt>CONTROL</tt>
        <dd>Device feature control. Second argument specifies function:
  <dl>
    <dt><tt>SETBAUD</tt>
        <dd>Changes baud rate.</dd>
    <dt><tt>GETBAUD</tt>
        <dd>Returns the current baud rate.</dd>
    <dt><tt>INSTALL_DBG_ISR</tt>
        <dd>[Unused]</dd>
    <dt><tt>REMOVE_DBG_ISR</tt>
        <dd>[Unused]</dd>
    <dt><tt>IRQ_DISABLE</tt>
        <dd>Disable debugging receive interrupts on the device.</dd>
    <dt><tt>IRQ_ENABLE</tt>
        <dd>Enable debugging receive interrupts on the device.</dd>
    <dt><tt>DBG_ISR_VECTOR</tt>
        <dd>Returns the ISR vector used by the device for debugging
        receive interrupts.</dd>
    <dt><tt>SET_TIMEOUT</tt>
        <dd>Set GETC timeout in milliseconds.</dd>
   </dl>

<dt><tt>DBG_ISR</tt>
        <dd>ISR used to handle receive interrupts from the device (see <a
        href="hal-stubs.html#async_bps">Asynchronous GDB
        breakpoints</a>).</dd>
<dt><tt>GETC_TIMEOUT</tt>
        <dd>Read a character from the device with timeout.</dd>
</dl>


<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>The standard eCos diagnostics IO functions use the channel
procedure table when CYGSEM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_DIAG is enabled. That
means that when you use diag_printf (or the libc printf function) the
stream goes through the selected console procedure table. If you use
the virtual vector function SET_CONSOLE_COMM you can change the device
which the diagnostics output goes to at run-time.</p>

<p>You can also use the table functions directly if desired
(regardless of the CYGSEM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_DIAG setting - assuming
the ROM monitor provides the services). Here is a small example which
changes the console to use channel 2, fetches the comm procs pointer
and calls the write function from that table, then restores the
console to the original channel:</p>

<pre>
#define T "Hello World!\n"

int
main(void)
{
    hal_virtual_comm_table_t* comm;
    int cur = CYGACC_CALL_IF_SET_CONSOLE_COMM(CYGNUM_CALL_IF_SET_COMM_ID_QUERY_CURRENT);

    CYGACC_CALL_IF_SET_CONSOLE_COMM(2);

    comm = CYGACC_CALL_IF_CONSOLE_PROCS();
    CYGACC_COMM_IF_WRITE(*comm, T, strlen(T));

    CYGACC_CALL_IF_SET_CONSOLE_COMM(cur);
}
</pre>

<p>Beware that if doing something like the above, you should only do
it to a channel which does not have GDB at the other end: GDB ignores
raw data, so you would not see the output.</p>


<h4>Compatibility</h4>

<p>The use of this service is controlled by the option
CYGSEM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_DIAG which is disabled per default on most
older platforms (thus preserving backwards compatibility with older
stubs). On newer ports, this option should always be set.

<h4>Implementation details</h4>

<p>There is an array of procedure tables (raw comm channels) for each
IO device of the platform which get initialized by the ROM monitor, or
optionally by a RAM startup configuration (allowing the RAM
configuration to take full control of the target).  In addition to
this, there's a special table which is used to hold mangler
procedures.</p>

<p>The vector table defines which of these channels are selected for
console and debugging IO respectively: console entry can be empty,
point to mangler channel, or point to a raw channel. The debugger
entry should always point to a raw channel.</p>

<p>During normal console output (i.e., diagnostic output) the console
table will be used to handle IO if defined. If not defined, the debug
table will be used.</p>

<p>This means that debuggers (such as GDB) which require text streams
to be mangled (O-packetized in the case of GDB), can rely on the ROM
monitor install mangling IO routines in the special mangler table and
select this for console output. The mangler will pass the mangled data
on to the selected debugging channel.</p>

<p>If the eCos configuration specifies a different console channel
from that used by the debugger, the console entry will point to the
selected raw channel, thus overriding any mangler provided by the ROM
monitor.</p>

<p>See hal_if_diag_* routines in hal_if.c for more details of the stream
path of diagnostic output. See cyg_hal_gdb_diag_* routines in
hal_stub.c for the mangler used for GDB communication.</p>

<pre>
FIXME: Other special channels are reserved for ethernet communication.

<h4>New platform ports</h4>

<p>Define CDL options CYGNUM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_COMM_CHANNELS,
CYGNUM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_DEBUG_CHANNEL, and
CYGNUM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_CONSOLE_CHANNEL.

<p>If CYGSEM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_DIAG is set, make sure the infra diag
code uses the hal_if diag functions:</p>

<pre>
 #define HAL_DIAG_INIT() hal_if_diag_init()
 #define HAL_DIAG_WRITE_CHAR(_c_) hal_if_diag_write_char(_c_)
 #define HAL_DIAG_READ_CHAR(_c_) hal_if_diag_read_char(&_c_)
</pre>

<p>In addition to the above functions, the platform HAL must also
provide a function cyg_hal_plf_comms_init which initializes the
drivers and the channel procedure tables.</t>

<p>Most of the other functionality in the table is more or less
possible to copy unchanged from existing ports. Some care is necessary
though to ensure the proper handling of interrupt vectors and timeouts
for various devices handled by the same driver. See PowerPC/Cogent
platform HAL for an example implementation.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> When vector table console code is <em>not</em> used,
the platform HAL must map the HAL_DIAG_INIT, HAL_DIAG_WRITE_CHAR and
HAL_DIAG_READ_CHAR macros directly to the low-level IO functions,
hardwired to use a compile-time configured channel.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> On old ports the hardwired HAL_DIAG_INIT,
HAL_DIAG_WRITE_CHAR and HAL_DIAG_READ_CHAR implementations will also
contain code to O-packetize the output for GDB. This should <b>not</b>
be adopted for new ports! On new ports the ROM monitor is guaranteed
to provide the necessary mangling via the vector table. The hardwired
configuration should be reserved for ROM startups where achieving
minimal image size is crucial.<p>
