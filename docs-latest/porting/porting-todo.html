<p>This is a list of things that should eventually be covered by the
porting guide.</p>

<h4>Constructors</h4>
<pre>
typedef void (*pfunc) (void)
extern pfunc __CTOR_LIST__[];
extern pfunc __CTOR_END__[];

void cyg_invoque_constructors(void)
{
   pfunc *p;
  for (p=&__CTOR_END__[-1];p >= __CTOR_LIST__;p--)
       (*p) ();
}


The two symbols are the limits of an array of pointers to
constructors. The pointers in this array get sorted (see linker
script) according to their priority. We add the brackets in the C code
to make the compiler treat the symbols as array references -- type
information only exists in the compiler; in the linker a symbols is
just named entity associated with an address.

The code above iterates through the array from the top to the bottom
(end-1 to start), calling each constructor in turn.

There's a compiler attribute for that:

#if defined(__cplusplus) && defined(__GNUC__)
# define CYGBLD_ATTRIB_INIT_PRI( _pri_ ) __attribute__((init_priority(_pri_)))
#else
// FIXME: should maybe just bomb out if this is attempted anywhere else?
// Not sure
# define CYGBLD_ATTRIB_INIT_PRI( _pri_ )
#endif

This is used a few places in the eCos code to control in which order
various constructors get run. Grep for CYGBLD_ATTRIB_INIT_PRI in the
sources.

<h4>Using ser_filter for serial IO monitoring</h4>

Unfortunately that doesn't always work. Any non-protocol data gets
binned by some GDBs - it's not consistent in this regard across
architectures.

Instead I suggest using the ser_filter for which sources are available
from the CVS repository in the host directory. You should be able to
rebuild it for Linux by invoking make in the host/tools/ecostest/unix
directory. For Windows I believe there are some MSVC build files
somewhere.

When you have ser_filter built you can do something like:

 $ ser_filter -m 9999 /dev/ttyS0 38400

And then connect to the target like this:

 (gdb) ta re localhost:9999


When you do, the ser_filter should dump all the traffic out on the
console.
