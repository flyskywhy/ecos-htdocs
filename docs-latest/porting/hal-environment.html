<dt><tt>CYGSEM_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR_X</tt>

<dd>Describes what to expect from the run-time environment when
    starting eCos configured for RAM startup. 

    <!-- Jifl/Hugo --><p>The option name may be a bit of a
    misnomer. Think of it as "there's a ROM monitor X on the
    board... work with it." Which might only mean "so the serial is
    already initialized; don't bother to do it a 2nd time" whilst
    still taking over the world (ie. not working with it, just not
    overwriting its prior good works).</p>


    <p><tt>CYGSEM_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR_GDB_stubs</tt> and
    <tt>CYGSEM_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR_CygMon</tt> are most
    common. Depending on other options, these may allow eCos to use
    services provided by the ROM monitor (see <a
    href="hal-calling-if.html">eCos/ROM Monitor Calling
    Interface</a>). Running under these environments also usually
    imply full debugging features with GDB.</p>

    <!-- Hugo --> <p>When working with older ROM monitors (which do
    not support the calling interface), the options are used to infer
    that we are likely to be connected to a GDB - and therefore $O
    packets should be used by hal_diag rather than plain text by
    default.  Which is more working with a likely other end of the
    serial line than working with the ROM itself.</p>

    <p>Other variants exist, such as CYGSEM_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR_PMON
    (used by the VRC4374 HAL). These may or may not provide all of the
    features provided by eCos GDB stubs/CygMon, but may still allow
    eCos to run under third party ROM monitors, using their IO
    routines for disagnostics output.</p>
