<H2>RedBoot Porting Process</H2>
<HR SIZE=3>

<p>RedBoot runs pretty much like a regular application, starting only
after all the normal HAL board initialization code has been run.  So
porting RedBoot to a new target takes about the same effort as a HAL
port since RedBoot is effectively layered on top of the eCos HAL.</p>

<p>Porting RedBoot can be done by following the eCos porting guide,
even though it is not necessary to complete all the eCos
functionality. The important parts are:</p>

<ol>
<li> redboot CDL
<li> board initialization
<li> simple polled serial driver
<li> GDB stubs support (if debugging functionality is required,
    otherwise it can be left out).
<li> timer initialization, allowing RedBoot to provide timeouts in
    scripts
<li> optianally add platform specific RedBoot commands
<li> optionally flash device driver
<li> optionally ethernet device driver

<p>FIXME: Add links to the above. Steps 2-4 are covered in the eCos
porting guide. The other steps are described below.</p>
