<H2>HAL Architecture Porting Process [TBD]</H2>
<HR SIZE=3>

<h4>Brief overview</h4>

<p>The easiest way to make a new architecture HAL is simply to copy an
existing architecture HAL of a, if possible, closely matching
architecture and change all the files to match the new
architecture. The MIPS architecture HAL should be used if possible, as
it has the appropriate layout and coding conventions. Other HALs
may deviate from that norm in various ways.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> eCos is written for GCC. It requires C and C++
compiler support as well as a few compiler features introduced during
eCos development - so compilers older than eCos may not provide these
feaures. Note that there is no C++ support for any 8 or 16 bit
CPUs. Before you can undertake an eCos port, you need the required
compiler support.
