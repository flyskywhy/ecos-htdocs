<HR SIZE=3>

<h5>Interrupt system</h5>
<ul>
<li> Path: (Vector decoding function) -&gt; Interrupt VSRs -&gt; Interrupt ISRs -&gt; Interrupt DSRs
<li> Porting: kernel clock, using hal/intr.c test to ensure it's
working
<li> Arbitration:  Where to draw the line between HAL an application responsibilities.
 See PPC mpc8xx HAL for examples of some simple interrupt arbiters.
<li> Context switches &amp; interrupts:
 <ul>
 <li> context switch code saves/restores interrupt state
 <li> initial thread context must enable interrupts.
 </ul>
</ul>

ISR/DSR description (Gary Thomas):

<pre>
The idea of this code (why I changed it in the first place) was to be
able to enable interrupts while processing DSRs, but insure that the
processing took place on the interrupt stack.  The previous implementation
had simply enabled interrupts in the VSR, after switching to the thread
stack, but before calling "interrupt_end".  This was clearly wrong as
it required all thread stacks to be large enough to handle any possible
interrupt nesting.

The way it is supposed to work is like this (pseudo-code to abstract
machine details):

VSR:
  mask interrupts (if necessary)
  save interrupt context on thread stack 
  lock scheduler
  switch to interrupt stack (if defined)
  call ISR
  switch back to thread stack
  call interrupt_end
  restore interrupt context from thread stack
  exit VSR

Note: interrupt_end called with interrupts disabled, scheduler locked

interrupt_end:
  possibly schedule a DSR, based on paramters from VSR
  drop scheduler lock  
  if scheduling enabled, run pending DSRs (actually just part of scheduling)
  note: interrupts are still disabled when entered from VSR

hal_interrupt_stack_call_pending_DSRs:
  [disable interrupts (may be moot)]
  switch to interrupt stack
  enable interrupts
  run DSRs
  disable interrupts
  switch back to thread stack
  restore interrupts


Remember the premise: run DSRs with interrupts enabled, using the separate
interrupt stack.  However, this can't be done directly by the VSR since DSRs
must be scheduled (i.e. they can't run until scheduling is allowed).  In
order to keep the knowledge of how this works (proper layering) out of the
VSRs, it has to be in 'interrupt_end', thus the additional complexity.
