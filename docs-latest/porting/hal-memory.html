<H2>Platform Memory Layout</H2>
<HR SIZE=3>

<p>The platform memory layout is defined using the Memory
Configuration Window [FIXME:ref] in the Configuration Tool.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>If you do not have access to a Windows machine, you can
hand edit the <tt>.h</tt> and <tt>.ldi</tt> files to match the
properties of your platform. If you want to contribute your port back
to the eCos community, ask someone on the list to make proper memory
map files for you.</p>

<h3>Layout Files</h3>

<p>The memory configuration details are saved in three files:</p>

<dl>
<dt><tt>.mlt</tt>
	<dd>This is the Configuration Tool save-file. It is only used
	by the Configuration Tool.</dd>
<dt><tt>.ldi</tt>
	<dd>This is the linker script fragment. It defines the memory
	and location of sections by way of macros defined in the
	architecture or variant linker script.</dd>
<dt><tt>.h</tt>
	<dd>This file describes some of the memory region details as C
	macros, allowing eCos or the application adapt the memory
	layout of a specific configuration.</dd>
</dl>

<p>These three files are generated for each startup-type, since the
memory details usually differ.</p>

<h4>Reserved Regions</h4>

<p>Some areas of the memory space are reserved for specific
purposes, making room for execption vectors and various tables. RAM
startup configurations also need to reserve some space at the bottom
of the memory map for the ROM monitor.</p>

<p>These reserved areas are named with the prefix "reserved_" which is
handled specially by the Configuration Tool: instead of referring to a
linker macro, the start of the area is labelled and a gap left in the
memory map.</p>
