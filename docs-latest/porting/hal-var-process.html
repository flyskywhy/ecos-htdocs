<H2>HAL Variant Porting Process [TBD]</H2>
<HR SIZE=3>


<h4>Brief overview</h4>

<p>The easiest way to make a new variant HAL is simply to copy an
existing variant HAL and change all the files to match the new
variant. If this is the first variant for an architecture, it may be
hard to decide which parts should be put in the variant - knowledge of
other variants of the architecture is required.</p> 

<p>Looking at existing variant HALs (e.g., MIPS tx39, tx49) may be a
help - usually things such as caching, interrupt and exception
handling differs between variants. Initialization code, and code for
handling various core components (FPU, DSP, MMU, etc.) may also differ
or lack altogether on some variants. Linker scripts may also require
specific variant versions.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Some CPU variants may require specific compiler
support. That support must be in place before you can undertake the
eCos variant port.</p>
