<p>The ethernet drivers are standard eCos ethernet drivers - except
that they are only used in polled mode from RedBoot. This is done with
the help of a poll() driver call which will simulate interrupts, and
thus drive the state machine of the driver.</p>

<p>See [xref] for more details on writing an ethernet driver for
eCos.</p>
