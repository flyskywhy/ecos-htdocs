<H2>RedBoot Ethernet Support</H2>
<HR SIZE=3>

<p>The ethernet drivers are standard eCos ethernet drivers - except
that they are only used in polled mode from RedBoot. This is done with
the help of a poll() driver call which will simulate interrupts, and
thus drive the state machine of the driver.</p>

<p>See [xref] for more details on writing an ethernet driver for
eCos.</p>


<pre>

_send & _recieve semantics - the sg list used to separate ethernet
frame header from IP frame.

Getting started: use server_test and ping target to see output. The
other way can be tricky if there's no output, or if the output gets
ignored by the host. (enable CYGPKG_NET_BUILD_TESTS)

Disable CYGHWR_NET_DRIVER_ETH0_BOOTP and CYGPKG_NET_DHCP, set
CYGHWR_NET_DRIVER_ETH0_ADDRS and suitable values in
CYGHWR_NET_DRIVER_ETH0_ADDRS_IP,
CYGHWR_NET_DRIVER_ETH0_ADDRS_BROADCAST and
CYGHWR_NET_DRIVER_ETH0_ADDRS_GATEWAY. 


gotcha: frame padding, may need to be enabled specifically, and hosts
will (silently!) ignore small packets.
