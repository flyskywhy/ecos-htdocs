<H2>Linker Script Macros [TBD]</H2>
<HR SIZE=3>

<p>When linking your application with eCos, an eCos-specific linker
script is used. This script specifies the linker rules as a set of
macros which are used by the linker script fragments generated for
each platform. The linker script can be defined either in the
architecture or in the variant HALs.</p>

<p>The linker script should be based on the linker script normally
used by the tools. This default script can be obtained by running this
command (replacing <tt>XXX</tt> with the architecture name):

<pre>
 $ XXX-elf-ld --verbose
</pre>

<p>The script should then be separated into per-section macros, and a
few eCos-specific extensions must be added. See any of the existing
linker scripts for further details.</p>



<h3>Macro details [TBD]</h3>

<p>Describe what all the macros do!?!</p>

(Jonathan Larmour)
<pre>
The objective is to get the output the same (or as similar
as possible anyway) to XXX-elf-ld --verbose.

This is what all HAL linker scripts should do as a basis for
their ports.
