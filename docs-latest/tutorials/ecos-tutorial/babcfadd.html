that provide GDB support for the Cirrus Logic EDB7211 Evaluation
Board fitted with the Cirrus Logic EP7211 CPU. Note that on some
board revisions, the board is silk-screened as EB7111-2. The first
Flash ROM image provides a port of the <SPAN

monitor, which includes a command-line interface and a <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>GDB</SPAN

stub. The second Flash ROM image provides a remote <SPAN

only.</P

>Both <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

ROMS allow communication with GDB via the serial connector labelled "UART
1". The communication parameters are fixed at 38400 baud, 8
data bits, no parity bit and 1 stop bit (8-N-1). No flow control
is employed. Connection to the host computer should be made using
a null modem cable. A gender changer may also be required. Note
that the <SPAN

the serial port identifiers 0 and 1 to identify the EB7211 serial
ports UART1 and UART2 respectively.</P
><P
>Both <SPAN

the core clock is generated with a 3.6864 MHz PLL input. The CPU
will be configured to run at 73.728MHz.</P
><P
>Note: The EP7211 CPU needs a two step RESET process. After
pressing the `URESET" pushbutton, the `WAKEUP" pushbutton
must be pressed to complete the process.</P

>6. The download program will indicate that it is waiting for
the board to come alive.  At this point, press "RESET" and
then "WAKEUP" switches in order.  There should
be some indication of progress, first of the code being downloaded,
then of the programming process.</P

>You must ensure that the board has the appropriate soldered
connections. For the EB7111 this involves connecting TEST0 and TEST1
of the EP7211 to ground. To do this you must solder a wire from
ground at JP33 to TP8 and TP9.</P
><P
>With respect to using multiple devices simultaneously, note
that the EP7211 is not ID sensitive.</P
><P
>If you wish to view diagnostic output from your program that
was downloaded via the Multi-ICE, you will note that by default
the output on the serial line (as viewed by a terminal such as Hyperterm
in Windows, or cu in Unix) is in the form of GDB packets.</P
><P
>To get legible output, the solution is to set the "GDB Serial
port" to a different device from the "Diagnostic serial port", and
you should use the Diagnostic serial port to view the diagnostic
output.</P
><P
>Warning: The multi-ice-gdb-server will fail on startup if
the board has not been both reset and awakened before running the
server. </P
><P
>To resolve this, it is necessary to free up the connection
from within the ARM Multi-ICE server itself. However when this happens,
the next time you use GDB to load the program into the board, you
will see lots of "Readback did not match original data" messages
in the output of the multi-ice-gdb-server program. This indicates
your program did not load correctly, and you should restart the
multi-ice-gdb-server program, taking care to reset the board correctly
before reconnecting. </P
><P
>As a reminder, you must specify --config-dialog to the multi-ice-gdb-server
program to connect to the board correctly. If you do not, the multi-ice-gdb-server
program will not be able to connect.</P
