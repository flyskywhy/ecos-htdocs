>When building a real-time system, care must be taken to ensure
that the system will be able to perform properly within the constraints
of that system. One of these constraints may be how fast certain
operations can be performed. Another might be how deterministic
the overall behavior of the system is. Lastly the memory footprint
(size) and unit cost may be important. </P
><P
>One of the major problems encountered while evaluating a system
will be how to compare it with possible alternatives. Most manufacturers
of real-time systems publish performance numbers, ostensibly so
that users can compare the different offerings. However, what these
numbers mean and how they were gathered is often not clear. The
values are typically measured on a particular piece of hardware,
so in order to truly compare, one must obtain measurements for exactly
the same set of hardware that were gathered in a similar fashion. </P
><P
>Two major items need to be present in any given set of measurements.
First, the raw values for the various operations; these are typically
quite easy to measure and will be available for most systems. Second,
the determinacy of the numbers; in other words how much the value
might change depending on other factors within the system. This value
is affected by a number of factors: how long interrupts might be
masked, whether or not the function can be interrupted, even very
hardware-specific effects such as cache locality and pipeline usage.
It is very difficult to measure the determinacy of any given operation,
but that determinacy is fundamentally important to proper overall
characterization of a system. </P
><P
>In the discussion and numbers that follow, three key measurements
are provided. The first measurement is an estimate of the interrupt
latency: this is the length of time from when a hardware interrupt
occurs until its Interrupt
Service Routine (ISR) is called. The second measurement is an estimate
of overall interrupt overhead: this is the length of time average
interrupt processing takes, as measured by the real-time clock interrupt
(other interrupt sources will certainly take a different amount
of time, but this data cannot be easily gathered). The third measurement
consists of the timings for the various kernel primitives. </P

><P
>Key operations in the kernel were measured by using a simple
test program which exercises the various kernel primitive operations.
A hardware timer, normally the one used to drive the real-time clock,
was used for these measurements. In most cases this timer can be
read with quite high resolution, typically in the range of a few microseconds.
For each measurement, the operation was repeated a number of times. Time
stamps were obtained directly before and after the operation was
performed. The data gathered for the entire set of operations was
then analyzed, generating average (mean), maximum and minimum values.
The sample variance (a measure of how close most samples are to
the mean) was also calculated. The cost of obtaining the real-time
clock timer values was also measured, and was subtracted from all
other times. </P
><P
>Most kernel functions can be measured
separately. In each case, a reasonable number of iterations are
performed. Where the test case involves a kernel object, for example creating
a task, each iteration is performed on a different object. There
is also a set of tests which measures the interactions between multiple
tasks and certain kernel primitives. Most functions are tested in
such a way as to determine the variations introduced by varying
numbers of objects in the system. For example, the mailbox tests
measure the cost of a "peek" operation when the
mailbox is empty, has a single item, and has multiple items present.
In this way, any effects of the state of the object or how many
items it contains can be determined. </P
><P
>There are a few things to consider about these measurements.
Firstly, they are quite micro in scale and only measure the operation
in question. These measurements do not adequately describe how the
timings would be perturbed in a real system with multiple interrupting
sources. Secondly, the possible aberration incurred by the real-time
clock (system heartbeat tick) is explicitly avoided. Virtually all
kernel functions have been designed to be interruptible. Thus the
times presented are typical, but best case, since any particular
function may be interrupted by the clock tick processing. This number
is explicitly calculated so that the value may be included in any
deadline calculations required by the end user. Lastly, the reported
measurements were obtained from a system built with all options
at their default values. Kernel instrumentation and asserts are
also disabled for these measurements. Any number of configuration
options can change the measured results, sometimes quite dramatically. For
example, mutexes are using priority inheritance in these measurements.
The numbers will change if the system is built with priority inheritance
on mutex variables turned off. </P
><P
>The final value that is measured is an estimate of interrupt
latency. This particular value is not explicitly calculated in the
test program used, but rather by instrumenting the kernel itself.
The raw number of timer ticks that elapse between the time the timer generates
an interrupt and the start of the timer ISR is kept in the kernel.
These values are printed by the test program after all other operations
have been tested. Thus this should be a reasonable estimate of the
interrupt latency over time. </P
