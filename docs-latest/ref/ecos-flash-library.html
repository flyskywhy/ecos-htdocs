>Notes on using the FLASH library</A
></H2
><P
>The FLASH library evolved from the needs and environment of RedBoot
rather than being a general purpose eCos component. This history
explains some of the problems with the library.  </P
><P
>The library is not thread safe. Multiple simultaneous calls to
its library functions will likely fail and may cause a crash. It is
the callers responsibility to use the necessary mutex's if needed.</P
><P
>FLASH devices cannot be read from when an erase or write
operation is active. This means it is not possible to execute code
from flash while an erase or write operation is active. It is possible
to use the library when the executable image is resident in FLASH. The
low level drivers are written such that the linker places the
functions that actually manipulate the flash into RAM.  However the
library may not be interrupt safe. An interrupt must not cause
execution of code that is resident in FLASH. This may be the image
itself, or RedBoot. In some configurations of eCos, ^C on the serial
port or debugging via Ethernet may cause an interrupt handler to call
RedBoot. If RedBoot is resident in FLASH this will cause a crash.
Similarly, if another thread invokes a virtual vector function to
access RedBoot, eg to perform a <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>diag_printf()</CODE
> a
crash could result.</P
><P
> Thus with a ROM based image or a ROM based Redboot it is
recommended to disable interrupts while erasing or programming
flash. Using both a ROMRAM or RAM images and a ROMRAM or RAM RedBoot
are safe and there is no need to disable interrupts. Similarly, </P

>Unlike nearly every other aspect of embedded system programming,
getting it wrong with FLASH devices can render your target system
useless. Most targets have a boot loader in the FLASH. Without this
boot loader the target will obviously not boot. So before starting to
play with this library its worth investigating a few things. How do
you recover your target if you delete the boot loader? Do you have the
necessary JTAG cable? Or is specialist hardware needed? Is it even
possible to recover the target boards or must it be thrown into the
rubbish bin? How does killing the board affect your project schedule?</P
