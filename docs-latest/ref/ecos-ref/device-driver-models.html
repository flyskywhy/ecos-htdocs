>Device Driver Models</A
></H1
><P
>There are several ways in which device
drivers may be built. The exact model chosen will depend on the
properties of the device and the behavior desired. There are three basic
models that may be adopted. </P
><P
>The first model is to do all device processing in the ISR.
When it is invoked the ISR programs the device hardware directly
and accesses data to be transferred directly in memory. The ISR
should also call <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
><B
>cyg_drv_interrupt_acknowledge()</B
></TT
>. When
it is finished it may optionally request that its DSR be invoked.
The DSR does nothing but call <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
><B
>cyg_drv_cond_signal()</B
></TT
> to
cause a thread to be woken up. Thread level code must call <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
><B
>cyg_drv_isr_lock()</B
></TT
>,
or <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
><B
>cyg_drv_interrupt_mask()</B
></TT
> to prevent ISRs
running while it manipulates shared memory. </P
><P
>The second model is to defer device processing to the DSR.
The ISR simply prevents further delivery of interrupts by either
programming the device, or by calling <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
><B
>cyg_drv_interrupt_mask()</B
></TT
>.
It may then call <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
><B
>cyg_drv_interrupt_acknowledge()</B
></TT
> to
allow other interrupts to be delivered and request that its DSR
be called. When the DSR runs it does the majority of the device
handling, optionally signals a condition variable to wake a thread,
and finishes by calling <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
><B
>cyg_drv_interrupt_unmask()</B
></TT
> to
re-allow device interrupts. Thread level code uses <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
><B
>cyg_drv_dsr_lock()</B
></TT
> to
prevent DSRs running while it manipulates shared memory. </P
><P
>The third model is to defer device processing even further
to a thread. The ISR behaves exactly as in the previous model and
simply blocks and acknowledges the interrupt before request that
the DSR run. The DSR itself only calls <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
><B
>cyg_drv_cond_signal()</B
></TT
> to
wake the thread. When the thread awakens it performs all device
processing, and has full access to all kernel facilities while it
does so. It should finish by calling <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
><B
>cyg_drv_interrupt_unmask()</B
></TT
> to
re-allow device interrupts. </P
><P
>The first model is good for devices that need immediate processing
and interact infrequently with thread level. The second model trades
a little latency in dealing with the device for a less intrusive
synchronization mechanism. The last model allows device processing
to be scheduled with other threads and permits more complex device
handling. </P
