is a API to allow user-defined VSRs to be installed. The default
VSR reads the interrupt controller registers and decodes the interrupt
source into an offset into a further table of interrupt service
routines. It also handles interrupt cleanup, which may result in
the execution of deferred service routines (DSRs) and the preemption
