<h1>eCos Problem Reports</h1>

<hr noshade size=3>

<h2>Reviewing problems</h2>

</p>If you believe you have found a problem with eCos, check the 
<a href="problemlist.html">known problems list</a>. The problem may have been
reported already. This list contains suggestions for working around certain
known problems. It may also be beneficial to search the
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/ml/ecos-discuss">archives for the
ecos-discuss mailing list</a> in case other people have had the same problem
but it was never entered into the bug tracking system.</p>

<p>Please note that we are unable to provide technical support to users of
the eCos net distribution. Red Hat can provide support via the
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/embedded/technologies/ecos/ecos_support.html"
target="_top">
eCos Developer Support Program</a> for those who require it.

<h2>Submitting a problem report</h2>

<p>If you have been unable to find reference to the problem you are
experiencing in the known problems list, please submit a problem report to
Red Hat using the <a href="http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/">Bugzilla
bug tracking system</a>. You will need to provide an e-mail address to register
with the bug system. By providing a problem report, you will
assist us in improving the software for the benefit of all users. It is
important to provide as much information as possible to enable our engineers
to reproduce and analyse the problem.</p>

<p>Remember to use the correct bug tracking system for the bug you are
reporting, i.e. use the GCC bug system for GCC bugs <i>only</i>, use the GDB
bug system for GDB bugs and use the eCos bug system for eCos bugs.</p>
