<h1>eCos Problem Reports</h1>

<hr noshade size=3>

<h2>Reviewing problems</h2>

</p>If you believe you have found a problem with eCos, check the 
<a href="problemlist.html">known problems list</a>. The problem may have been
reported already. This list contains suggestions for working around certain
known problems. Also query the
<a href="http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/query.cgi?product=eCos">
eCos Bugzilla bug tracking database</a> to see if the bug has already been
entered, and possibly even fixed in a later version. It may also be beneficial
to search the <a href="/ml/ecos-discuss">archives for the ecos-discuss
mailing list</a> in case other people have had the same problem but it was
never entered into the bug tracking system.</p>

<h2>Submitting a problem report</h2>

<p>If you have been unable to find a reference to the problem you are
experiencing in the known problems list or the current Bugzilla database,
please submit a problem report to the eCos net community using the
<a href="http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/">Bugzilla bug tracking system</a>.
You will need to provide an e-mail address to register with Bugzilla.
By providing a problem report, you will assist us in improving the software
for the benefit of all users. It is important to provide as much information
as possible to enable us to reproduce and analyze the problem.</p>

<p>Remember to use the correct bug tracking system for the bug you are
reporting, i.e. use the GCC bug system for GCC-specific bugs <i>only</i>, use
the GDB bug system for GDB bugs and use the eCos bug system for eCos bugs. 
However if the problem you are reporting is generated by the tools but is
specific to the eCos environment and no others, reporting using the eCos
bug system may be more appropriate. Use your own judgement. Do <i>not</i>
submit the bug into more than one system though.</p>

<p>Also please try to use the bug systems to report problems you believe
to be genuine bugs or shortcomings in the software or documentation,
rather than general requests for help. The <a href="intouch.html">ecos-discuss
mailing list</a> is a better forum for requests of that nature.</p>
