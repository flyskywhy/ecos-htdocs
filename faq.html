<H3>What is eCos?</H3>

<H4><A NAME="what_ecos">What is eCos?</A></H4>

eCos (embedded Cygnus operating system) is an open-source,
royalty-free, highly configurable, application-specific operating
system ideal for embedded systems development. eCos is targeted at
high-volume applications in consumer electronics, telecommunications,
automotive, and other deeply embedded applications. eCos ensures
embedded developers have a common software infrastructure for
delivering a diverse range of embedded products and enables embedded
software developers to focus on delivering better products, instead of
developing or maintaining a real-time operating system in addition
to the products themselves.

<H4><A NAME="what_why">Why has Cygnus produced another embedded
real-time operating system?</A></H4>

Even with so many commercially available run-time solutions, more than
50 percent of all embedded projects today are built using in-house
proprietary, or &quot;roll your own&quot;, real-time technologies (Venture
Development Corporation). Cygnus partnered with microprocessor vendors
and embedded product manufacturing companies to develop eCos around
the requirement of an open, technically advanced run-time solution.
eCos was designed to address the following fundamental issues that
force embedded product manufacturing companies to develop their own
run-time technologies:

<UL TYPE=DISC>
  <LI><B>Cost</B> - eCos is royalty free and license cost free. It is
portable across chip architectures, which makes it well-suited for
software developers of high-volume applications in consumer
electronics, telecommunications, automotive and other deeply embedded
applications,
  <P>
  <LI><B>Control</B> - eCos is an open-source run-time
technology which fosters innovation, reduces risk, and places
customers in control of their application specific content by enabling
programmers on the Internet to read, redistribute, and modify the
source code for eCos.
  <P>
  <LI><B>Technical Fit</B> - eCos provides source-level
configuration (more than 200 configuration points) to exactly match
application needs and is tightly integrated with the latest version of
GNUPro tools, including highly optimized compilation technology,
multi-threaded debugging, graphical configuration, test suites, etc.
</UL>

<P>
<H4><A NAME="what_source">Do you provide the source code?</A></H4>

<P>
Absolutely. In fact Cygnus wants to run eCos development as an open
source project, with the cooperation of the development community on
the net. Cygnus has many years of experience in this field through our
work on the gcc and g++ compilers, the gdb debugger, and many other
tools. The same development model has proved an overwhelming success
in many other projects, most famously Linux. 

<P>
<H4><A NAME="what_configurability">What do you mean by configurability?</A></H4>

<P>
Embedded systems have an amazing range of requirements, from 4 bit
controllers up to large radar arrays with a thousand or so top of
the range processors. Even if we limit the eCos target market to
deeply embedded devices and to processors for which a gcc port is
available, it is not possible to write a single system which meets
everybody's requirements. The conventional approach forces application
developers to adapt their software so that it works within the
limitations of the operating system. The eCos approach is to provide a
whole range of options and let the developer configure a system that
best matches the needs of the application. Typical configuration
options include the type of scheduler and the number of priority
levels. The current release of the system has over 200 such options,
and plenty more will be added as the system evolves.

<P>
Code and data size are vitally important for many embedded
applications, so configurability must be achieved without adding any
overheads. Some of it can be done at link time, but for maximum
benefit most of it happens at compile time. It is possible for a
configuration option to affect a single line of code, when this is
appropriate. On the other hand a single configuration option might
control the presence or absence of a complete TCP/IP stack. For system
code written in C or C++ the main mechanism that is employed is C
preprocessor #ifdef statements, which will be familiar to most
embedded application developers.

<P>
Using #ifdef statements to provide a small number of configuration
options is of course not very original. The critical problem is that
configuration options are not independent: for example, changing a
kernel option may affect whether or not the C library can provide
thread-safe versions of various routines. The key innovation in eCos
is that configuration options are treated as data items in their
own right, complete with descriptions of all the dependencies between
the various options. There is a graphical configuration tool which
allows users to conveniently manipulate the various options,
understand the various interactions, and check that the resulting
configuration is valid.

<P>
The configuration framework also serves to componentize the system
into different packages. The core system consists of a number of
different packages including the kernel, the C library, and the maths
library. It is possible to enable or disable entire
packages, as well as to manipulate configuration options within these
packages. It is also possible to add new packages to the system, for
example a TCP/IP stack. The key point is that these new packages can
specify dependencies on other parts of the system, for example the
TCP/IP stack could specify that it needs per-thread data support. The
same technology that makes configurability work in the core system
allows new packages to be added to the system and readily incorporated
into an application. We expect large numbers of these packages to
become available over time, and already there are software vendors who
want to turn their existing software into eCos packages. We expect
that many contributions from the open source community will take the
form of ports of existing software or of completely new packages.

<P>
The eCos configuration system does not affect how you develop your own
application code. It is not necessary to write your application in any
special language, or to provide lots of configuration options in your
own code, or to use a special development environment. The main output
from the configuration system is a library that gets linked with your
application code in the usual manner.

<P>
<H4><A NAME="what_size">What are the performance figures?</A></H4>

<P>
A side effect of a fully configurable system is that it is just about
impossible to answer questions like &quot;What is the memory footprint
of the kernel?&quot or &quot;What is the interrupt latency?&quot;
These figures depend in large part on the configuration options
selected by the user. For example if a simple application does not
require the kernel at all, directly or indirectly, then the kernel
package can be disabled completely and its memory footprint is 0
bytes. 

<P>
<A
HREF="docs-1.1/guides/user-guides/real-time-characterization.html">Basic
performance characterization data</A> is available as part of the
documentation, together with a description of the tests that were used
to obtain this data. The sources for these tests are included with the
eCos distribution.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="what_mail">Are there any mailing lists?</A></H4>

<P>
Certainly. There are two main mailing lists which anybody can <A
HREF="intouch.html">subscribe</A> to. The &lt;ecos-announce&gt; mailing list
is a low-volume moderated list for major announcements. The
&lt;ecos-discuss&gt; mailing list is an unmoderated list for general
discussion, both technical and non-technical. All of Cygnus's eCos
development team will read this list and join in the discussions as
appropriate. Archives for both <A
HREF="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ml/ecos-announce/">&lt;ecos-announce&gt;</A>
and <A
HREF="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ml/ecos-discuss/">&lt;ecos-discuss&gt;</A>
are available.

<P>
If you have a question which you do not want to discuss in a public
forum then there is a separate <A
HREF="mailto:ecos-maintainers@cygnus.com">&lt;ecos-maintainers&gt;</A> mail
address. All requests sent to this request will be considered
confidential, and nobody outside Cygnus is able to subscribe to this
list.

<h3>What are the licensing terms?</h3>

<h4><A NAME="license_terms">What are the licensing terms?</A></h4>

<P>
eCos is released under a new license, the <A HREF="license.html">Cygnus
eCos Public License</A> or CEPL for short. You can also read an
<A HREF="http://www.cygnus.com/ecos/annotate.html">annotated
version</A> of the license and the <A
HREF="http://www.cygnus.com/ecos/motiv.html">motivations</A> for the
license.  <P>

<h4><A NAME="license_meaning">OK, but what does this license actually mean?</A></h4>

<P>
You can use eCos to develop products without paying anybody anything,
no matter how many developers are working on the product or how many
units you expect to ship. This applies not only to the core system
itself but also to any changes anybody makes to the core system.

<P>
A key aspect of the eCos public license is that it is intended to
protect the eCos user community as a whole. It should prevent any
company or individual contributing code to the system and then claim
that all eCos users are now guilty of copyright or patent
infringements and have to pay royalties. It should also prevent any
company from making some small improvements, calling the result a
completely new system, and releasing this under a new and less
generous license.

<P>
The license does impose one obligation on application developers: you
must include a <A HREF="license.html#B">notice</A> with your
product indicating that it makes use of eCos. 

<P>
<h4><A NAME="license_give_source">Do I have to give away the source code of my application?</A></h4>

<P>
No. Your application source code is your own, to do with as you
please. As far as the eCos public license is concerned you are under
no obligation to reveal a single line of your source code to Cygnus or
to anybody else. In fact you do not even have to tell Cygnus about the
existence of your project, although we would love to know about all
the different products that use eCos.

<P>
<h4><A NAME="license_core_changes">What about changes to the core system?</A></h4>

<P>
If you make a change to the core eCos system then we believe that
the entire user community should have the opportunity to benefit from
that change. This does not necessarily mean that your changes will
become part of the core system, since there are fairly strict criteria
that have to be satisfied before any contribution will be
incorporated. However any such decisions will be made by the eCos
maintainers, not by the person making the changes.

<P>
<h4><A NAME="license_core">What exactly is the core system?</A></h4>

<P>
eCos is designed to be the component framework for the embedded
systems industry. An eCos release consists of a number of different
packages including the kernel, the C library, and a uITRON
compatibility layer. All the packages that go into such a release and
the associated documentation constitute the core system, and the
license describes this using the term &quot;Original Code&quot;.

<P>
Another way of looking at this is from a purely practical perspective.
At the end of the day building an application involves linking
together some application-specific object files with some libraries.
The current eCos build system will produce a library libtarget.a,
containing all the packages that the user has selected. All the source
code that goes into the building of this library is part of the core
system and is covered by the eCos public license. Anything which goes
into the application-specific object files is not part of the core
system and is not covered by the public license. Note that this is not
a legally binding definition - in particular you cannot get around the
public license simply by copying bits of eCos sources and making them
part of your application code.

<P>
<h4><A NAME="license_packages">What about other packages?</A></h4>

<P>
Typically other packages will end up as other libraries that need to
be linked with the application code. These other packages may be
covered by different licenses, and application developers should make
sure that the requirements for all licenses are satisfied.

<P>
Some companies or organizations may release packages that are not open
source or freely available. Instead the application developer may have
to pay a one-off license fee or quite possibly per-unit royalties if
the application uses such a package. Not only is this perfectly legal,
Cygnus would very much like other companies to make money by providing
such packages.

<P>
Some packages may be released under the eCos public license without
becoming part of the core system. Typically this will happen if the
eCos maintainers believe that they would be unable to maintain such a
package themselves, for example because it relies on special hardware.

<P>
<h4><A NAME="license_new_packages">What if I create a new package?</A></h4>

<P>
There are two possibilities. If the new package is derived in large
part from some existing software then it is likely that there are
existing license restrictions that will apply. For example if you
create a new eCos device driver by copying an existing one and editing
it then this would constitute a modification to existing code and the
eCos public license would apply to the new device driver. If you
create a new device driver from scratch then you can decide for
yourself what license should apply. If you want the package to be
freely available to the entire eCos community then we recommend the
eCos public license, but the choice is yours.

<P>
<h4><A NAME="license_why_new">Why has Cygnus created a new license?</A></h4>

<P>
Balancing the needs and desires of all the companies, organizations,
and individuals involved with eCos is difficult. The most important
requirement is that the freedom of all eCos users is protected: it
must be impossible for anybody, even Cygnus, to impose restrictions on
how the system can be used now or in the future. Some existing
licenses such as the X11 license do not provide this.

<P>
It is also desirable that all enhancements are made available to the
community as a whole, thus improving the system and making it even
more attractive to potential users. Some existing licenses such as the
BSD license do not provide this.

<P>
The GNU Public License does meet these requirements, but it goes
further: all applications that get linked with GPL'd code are also
covered by the GPL, which means in practice that application
developers have to make the sources available. In the embedded systems
market this requirement is generally considered unacceptable and many
companies refuse to use any GPL'd code as a result. This would reduce
the uptake of eCos, and we want as many people as possible to use the
system. 

<P>
The Netscape Public License came closest to meeting the requirements.
There were some modifications to reflect the needs of embedded system
developers, and the result was the eCos public license.

<P>
<h4><A NAME="license_coverage">Does the license cover situation ...?</A></h4>
Hopefully yes, but there may be situations that we have missed. If you
have any queries about the license and how it applies to your
situation, please contact us. There are both public and private
channels of communication available, depending on your requirements.
We are always interested in suggested improvements to the license that
are compatible with our overall goals.

<P>

<P>
<h3><A NAME="porting">Porting</A></h3>

<P>
<h4><A NAME="porting_does_it">Does eCos run on processor X?</A></h4>

<P>
Details of the supported architectures are published on the eCos home
page. If a particular processor is not listed there then support for
that processor is not yet available.

<P>
<h4><A NAME="porting_will_cygnus">Will Cygnus be porting eCos to
processor X?</A></h4>

<P>
Whenever possible once Cygnus starts working on a particular port we
will announce this fact immediately, to avoid any risk of contributors
duplicating work that is already ongoing. If a port has not yet
started but is under consideration then typically we will also make
this clear. Occasionally we have to be cautious in what we can reveal,
and an understanding of the underlying business model is useful here.

<P>
eCos is freely available, so Cygnus cannot earn any direct revenues in
the form of unit royalties or development seat licenses. However we
still need to earn money by one means or another - Cygnus is a
company, not a charitable organization.

<P>
When Cygnus makes a reference release of eCos which includes ports to
particular processors, those ports are certified. This means that we
are willing to provide guarantees about the quality of the system on
that processor. If somebody takes out a technical support contract for
that processor and runs into problems, we will sort out those
problems. Obviously we need to be pretty confident about the overall
quality of the system and about each specific processor port before we
can make guarantees like this. This requires very extensive QA work
and continuous testing on all supported targets as the system evolves,
and such things require a significant allocation of resources. In fact
the initial port to a particular processor is a relatively small
proportion of the overall effort involved.

<P>
As the use of eCos spreads through the embedded industry we can expect
to earn revenue through technical support contracts, through
consultancy work in the form of custom modifications or enhancements
to the system, and through a number of other means. This is
essentially the same model as used in some other parts of our
business, for example the GnuPro toolkit. However these revenue
sources take time to ramp up.

<P>
For Cygnus to embark on a new port we must be confident that we can
recoup the investment involved. In addition, given that there are many
processors we could be porting to, not to mention further development
to the main system, and also given that engineering resources are
limited, we need to prioritize the ports in some fashion.

<P>
It so happens that Cygnus already has very close relationships with
many leading silicon vendors through the GnuPro business. Typically
when a silicon vendor produces a new processor they will want various
tools such as a C compiler, a C++ compiler, and a debugger. These
tools will then be used by application developers, so more products
get developed using the processor and more chips get sold. The GNU
tools are of course ideal for this: technically they are
industry-leading; the quality is very high, again a prerequisite
before we can offer technical support; the tools are already familiar
to many developers; and they are free, source and all. This is a
winning combination, and a proportion of Cygnus's revenue comes from
porting the tools to new processors.

<P>
The same reasoning applies to eCos: having an open source and free
operating system available for a given processor makes that processor
more attractive to potential application developers, so the silicon
vendor is likely to sell more chips. Hence Cygnus is in discussion
with many silicon vendors about doing a certified port of eCos to
particular processors. Having the silicon vendors sponsor ports in
this way provides Cygnus with early revenue, which can then be pumped
back into further development of the system. The silicon vendors gain
an initial competitive advantage by having eCos available on their
processor early on.

<P>
Unfortunately negotiating deals like this is a non-trivial operation.
Typically all such discussions involve non-disclosure agreements
(NDA's), so legally we are not allowed to discuss the status of any of
these negotiations or even which processors are involved. There are
also commercial considerations, for example it is possible that we
might be talking to a number of different parties about porting to a
processor architecture, to a specific processor, or to a particular
board. Providing detailed information to the net community may harm
such negotiations, resulting in loss of revenue for Cygnus and hence
fewer resources which can be used for further system development.

<P>
If we are specifically asked whether or not Cygnus is planning a port
to a particular architecture and such a port is under consideration,
then we will say so. However we will not reveal any detailed
information which is commercially sensitive or which would violate an
NDA, for example we might not be able to say which particular variant
of a processor architecture we would be working on. This is a
necessary compromise between our commercial requirements and our
desire for an open development process.

<P>
In most cases, once work starts on a particular port we will announce
this fact immediately. This avoids people doing their own port to a
particular processor at the same time as Cygnus. If there is already a
port to that processor in progress then typically we would work with
the existing developers to avoid duplication of effort. Such
collaboration would save Cygnus a certain amount of work, but there
would still be plenty left for us to do: most importantly the QA and
continuous testing that comes with a certified port of eCos, but also
board ports to whichever board(s) are selected by the silicon vendor.

<P>
<h4><A NAME="porting_how_would_I">How would I go about porting eCos to
a new processor?</A></h4>

<P>
A sensible first step for this, as for any other non-trivial project
involving eCos, would be to find out whether or not anybody else
(either inside or outside Cygnus) is already working on something
similar. One way of doing this is to post a message to the
<A HREF="mailto:ecos-discuss@cygnus.com">ecos-discuss@cygnus.com</A>
mailing list. If you prefer a more confidential communication channel
for any reason you can instead send email to
<A HREF="mailto:ecos-maintainers@cygnus.com">ecos-maintainers@cygnus.com</A>
- any such messages will not be seen by
anybody outside Cygnus. We aim to keep track of every ongoing eCos
project that we know about, to avoid duplication of effort.

<P>
The next step is to make sure that you have a toolchain that is
suitable for your target hardware. This means the compilers gcc and
g++, the assembler gas, the linker, and the various binutils such as
ar. It will also be necessary to have some way of actually running an
executable on the target hardware, an operation which is inherently
hardware dependent. On many targets this will already be possible via
the debugger gdb, but on other targets it may be necessary to get gdb
to work with the board first or to use some other technique. The eCos
download page includes the sources for such a toolchain: it has only
been tested for the processors that are officially supported, and only
on Red Hat 5.1 Linux and on Windows NT hosts; it is likely that these
tools can also be built for many other processors and hosts, possibly
with a little bit of tweaking, but we do not offer any guarantees.

<P>
It should be noted that eCos uses a number of relatively new
extensions to the GNU tools, and you may well run into problems if you
try to use some other release of the tools. The most important
extension is constructor priority ordering, which allows us to control
the order in which static C++ objects get constructed. For example it
is possible to specify that a scheduler object gets created before any
thread objects. This extension is likely to work with any processor
that uses the ELF object format, but there will be problems with other
object formats: please contact the eCos maintainers if you need more
information about this. Another new extension is selective linking,
which will result in smaller executables but which is not absolutely
required for a working eCos port. This extension requires
modifications to the toolchain for each architecture, and is not yet
available except for the supported architectures. Work is in progress
to make sure that these extensions work correctly for all
architectures that use ELF object format, and to make the extensions
available as part of the main net releases for the various tools.

<P>
Assuming a working toolchain, porting to a new processor mainly
involves implementing a new architectural HAL package. There are
existing packages for the MN10300, TX39, and PowerPC processors which
can be used as a starting point. An initial specification of the eCos
HAL is available
<A HREF="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos/docs-1.1/ref/ecos-ref/the-ecos-hardware-abstraction-layer-hal.html">
online</A>.
As you might expect, the work involved in porting eCos is very similar
to the work involved in porting any embedded operating system:
hardware initialization, interrupt handling, processor exceptions,
context switching, etc.

<P>
It is worth pointing out that the current HAL specification is not
definitive and is in fact under active review. Three ports is not
enough to guarantee that the specification provides a true abstraction
of all processors. The documentation includes information about some
things that we know are missing. Any port attempted at this stage of
the system's development will need a certain amount of maintenance as
the HAL specification evolves.

<P>
In addition to the architectural HAL package it will be necessary to
do a platform HAL package, in other words to provide the support for
an actual development board. This involves issues such as board
initialization, diagnostics, possibly gdb support, and linker scripts.
There are existing platform HAL packages for the stdeval1, jmr3904,
and Cogent boards, and for various simulators.

<P>
<h4><A NAME="porting_adopt">Will Cygnus adopt my port?</A></h4>

<P>
If somebody produces a port to a new processor but does not wish to
maintain it indefinitely then Cygnus may be willing to adopt this
port. This involves certifying the port: extensive QA, quite possibly
code clean-ups so that it satisfies the coding standards, possibly new
documentation, and lots of testing. In addition we will maintain the
port, upgrading it as the HAL specification evolves. The effort
involved is considerable, and over time it will be significantly
larger than the initial port. Usually Cygnus will only be able to
afford to do so if there are likely to be sufficient long-term
revenues, for example if there are enough existing users of the
processor who might be interested in technical support. Also, we would
need a ready source of suitable hardware that can be used for the
testing, and we would need a copyright assignment for such ports.

<P>
However a port does not have to be supported by Cygnus or by anybody
else for it to be useful to somebody. If a port (or any other eCos
package) does not have an active maintainer then Cygnus can still make
it available as unsupported software, providing space on our ftp
server and suitable links in the web pages. This allows people to
download and use such ports. If there are enough users for an
unsupported port then perhaps somebody else will take over the
maintainership. The same is of course true for any piece of
contributed software.

<P>
If a port is not included in the reference releases but still has a
maintainer outside Cygnus, we can provide certain resources to assist
with this. For example we can provide mailing lists, web and ftp
services, and anonymous CVS access.

<P>
<h4><A NAME="porting_board">How about porting eCos to a new
board?</A></h4>

<P>
As with a processor port, usually the first step is to publicize your
intention and make sure that nobody else is already doing this. The
second step is to make sure that you have the necessary tools, in
particular some way of running an executable on the target board. It
is possible that gdb already provides support for that board.
Alternatively it may be necessary to add the necessary support to gdb,
or to use some other means of running programms.

<P>
Assuming a working toolchain, the work involved on the eCos side is to
implement a new platform HAL package. This involves issues such as
board initialization, diagnostics, possibly gdb support, and linker
scripts. There are existing platform HAL packages for the stdeval1,
jmr3904, and Cogent boards, and these can be used as starting points.

<P>
<h4><A NAME="porting_compiler">What are the compiler dependencies?</A></h4>

<P>
eCos depends heavily on a number of language extensions provided by
the gcc and g++ compilers. In fact a number of these extensions were
added to these compilers specifically to support eCos (although they
have wider applications as well). The first such extension is C++
constructor priority ordering. When you define several C++ static
objects the language does not define the order in which these objects
get constructed. g++ now allows static objects to be ordered using the
<TT>__attribute__</TT> mechanism, so for example it is possible to
create a scheduler object before any thread objects. The second
extension is selective linking. Traditionally linkers worked in terms
of compilation units, in other words entire files: if an application
needed a particular function from a library then all other library
functions which happened to be in the same source file would become
part of the application's executable. Instead the linker will now work
at the finer granularity of individual functions or variables.

<P>
Other extensions provided by gcc and g++ are used wherever
appropriate. For example attributes are used to define some functions
with weak linkage and to provide aliases for some functions. Inline
assembler is used to establish memory barriers and prevent the
compiler from optimising in places where this would be undesirable,
for example in context switch code. Computed goto's may be used during
exception handling.

<P>
The use of these extensions makes it very difficult to use compilers
other than gcc and g++ to build eCos. In addition it is possible that
other extensions will be used in future if they prove to be
appropriate for the problem at hand. Therefore we recommend against
attempting to use any other compiler technology for eCos development.

<h3>Contributing</h3>
<P>

<h4><A NAME="contrib_have_to">Do I have to contribute?</A></h4>

<P>
No. We expect that most people will simply want to use the system as
it is (or rather, as it is after they have configured it to meet their
specific needs), without changing the core system itself or adding any
new packages. Such users are under no obligation to contribute.

<P>
<h4><A NAME="contrib_bazaar">Which development model - cathedral or bazaar?</A></h4>

<P>
The <A
HREF="http://www.earthspace.net/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar.html">bazaar</A> of course. For the eCos system Cygnus is
committed to an open development model. In addition to the full
releases we will be making regular snapshot releases and provide
anonymous CVS access to the sources. Discussions about the system will
generally be held in the open <A HREF="intouch.html">&lt;ecos-discuss&gt;</A>
mailing list. However it is necessary to apply a caveat to this. Many
of Cygnus's commercial dealings involve confidential information and
are covered by non-disclosure agreements. A potential port to another
architecture would generally be covered by such an agreement, and
hence we would not be able to disclose any details in an open forum.

<P>
<h4><A NAME="contrib_how">How do I contribute?</A></h4>

<P>
There are ways of contributing to eCos development which involve very
little effort. Providing constructive comments on any part of the
system, including the documentation and the web site, helps us to
identify areas which need improvement. Reporting a problem gives us a
chance to fix it, especially if you provide us with a simple test case
and sufficient information to reproduce the problem. Participation in
the discussions in the <A HREF="intouch.html">&lt;ecos-discuss&gt;</A> mailing
list gives us a better understanding of the user community, and
perhaps some new ideas.

<P>
If you wish to contribute to the actual code there are multiple
levels of involvement. You can write a new package. This could be a
HAL package as part of a port of the system to new hardware. It could
be a device driver. It could provide some new functionality such as a
graphics library. It could be a port of some existing software that is
appropriate for embedded systems. You can enhance an existing package,
for example the eCos kernel. If you find a bug in the system then you
can provide a patch that fixes it. You may also find a way to rewrite
some existing code so that it becomes more efficient and/or needs less
memory. You may add new functionality. Contributions to the
documentation and to the test suites are particularly welcome, since
these areas are often overlooked by contributors.

<P>
Small patches can be sent directly to the &lt;ecos-discuss&gt; mailing list.
For larger patches it is better to send a message to the mailing list
indicating where the patch can be found. An ftp upload area will be
installed on the sourceware server in the near future to facilitate
submission of patches. For non-trivial patches to the core system we
may require a copyright assignment.

<P>
<h4><A NAME="contrib_what">What code contributions would be accepted?</A></h4>

<P>
The most important criterion is that the contribution must enhance the
system. If it meets this fundamental criterion then there is a good
chance that the contribution will be accepted. More specific criteria
include the following:

<P>
<OL>
  <LI>It must not have undesirable effects in terms of code
      size, data size, CPU cycles, or determinism of the system. This
      restriction can be relaxed if the new behaviour can only be
      explicitly enabled by means of one or more configuration
      options.
      <P>
  <LI>It must be portable to all affected platforms. Usually
      this means that for anything except a new HAL package the code
      must be fully portable.
      <P>
  <LI>It should adhere to the project's coding standards. 
      Most importantly the new code should contain
      appropriate assertions and comments.
      <P>
  <LI>Where appropriate (which is nearly always) it should be
      accompanied by appropriate test cases and documentation.
      <P>
  <LI>There must not be any confusion about licensing or ownership.
      This may require a copyright assignment.
</OL>

<P>
A contribution need not meet all these requirements immediately. In
fact it often makes sense to start with a proposal on the <A
HREF="intouch.html">&lt;ecos-discuss&gt;</A> mailing list, possibly including
an initial patch which is known to be unacceptable, with the
understanding that the contributor will make further changes. If there
are major problems with the proposed contribution then it is better to
detect these early on. If there is existing code elsewhere which does
much the same job then it is good to know about this as well, to avoid
duplication of effort. There may be better and easier ways to tackle
the problem. If you want to discuss a proposal using more private
communication channels rather than a public mailing list then you can
send email directly to <A
HREF="mailto:ecos-maintainers@cygnus.com">&lt;ecos-maintainers@cygnus.com&gt;</A>.

<P>
<h4><A NAME="contrib_assign">Why do I need to sign a copyright assignment?</A></h4>

<P>
If a contribution involves a significant change to part of the core
system, for example the kernel, then usually we will need a <A
HREF="assign.html">copyright assignment</A> before we can incorporate
the changes into the system. The reason for this is to protect the
community at large. In theory there is no need for copyright
assignments because all changes to code covered by the eCos public
license are also covered by that license. In practice copyright
assignment provides a useful extra level of protection.

<P>
As an example, consider a scenario where a junior programmer makes a
change to the system and releases it without the knowledge or consent
of management. Some time later management finds out about the
contribution, and decides that it should not have happened. The junior
programmer gets severely reprimanded. The company's lawyers now
approach Cygnus and various users of eCos, claiming that the
contribution violated the company's copyright or quite possibly a
patent, and demanding royalties. Until the issue gets resolved there
would be a significant amount of fear, uncertainty, and doubt amongst
the development community. This would be very harmful. The process of
copyright assignment should prevent this and many other scenarios from
ever arising, because it includes having a disclaimer signed by an
officer of the company or a person with the necessary authority.

<P>
We are aware that copyright assignments involve an unpleasant amount
of bureaucracy for many contributors, especially since we have to deal
with the paperwork at the other end. However, we believe that the
additional protection offered is necessary for the eCos user community
as a whole. 

<P>
<h4><A NAME="contrib_projects">I want to start work today! What should I work on?</A></h4>

<P>
Our intention is to provide a set of web pages indicating various
projects that people can work on. These pages will include projects
already in progress and projects that have been suggested but that
have not yet started. Typically additions to these projects will be
proposed on the <A HREF="intouch.html">&lt;ecos-discuss&gt;</A> mailing list,
discussed for a while, and then a summary will be prepared. Until
these pages are ready the best place to start would be the
&lt;ecos-discuss&gt; mailing list itself.
