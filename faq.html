<H3>What is eCos?</H3>

<H4><A NAME="what_ecos">What is eCos?</A></H4>

eCos (Embedded Cygnus Operating System) is an open-source,
royalty-free, highly configurable, application-specific operating
system ideal for embedded systems development. eCos is targeted at
high-volume applications in consumer electronics, telecommunications,
automotive, and other deeply embedded applications. eCos ensures
embedded developers have a common software infrastructure for
delivering a diverse range of embedded products and enables embedded
software developers to focus on delivering better products instead of
developing or maintaining a real-time operating system before
beginning the development of a product.

<H4><A NAME="what_why">Why has Cygnus produced another embedded
real-time operating system?</A></H4>

Even with so many commercially available run-time solutions, more than
50 percent of all embedded projects today are built using in-house
proprietary, or &quot;roll your own&quot;, real-time technologies (Venture
Development Corporation). Cygnus partnered with microprocessor vendors
and embedded product manufacturing companies to develop eCos around
the requirement of an open, technically advanced run-time solution.
eCos was designed to address the following fundamental issues that
force embedded product manufacturing companies to develop their own
run-time technologies:

<UL TYPE=DISC>
  <LI><B>Cost</B> - eCos is royalty free, delivered with
the microprocessor and portable across chip architectures, which makes
it well-suited for software developers of high-volume applications in
consumer electronics, telecommunications, automotive and other deeply
embedded applications,
  <P>
  <LI><B>Control</B> - eCos is an open-source run-time
technology which fosters innovation, reduces risk, and places
customers in control of their application specific content by enabling
programmers on the Internet to read, redistribute, and modify the
source code for eCos,
  <P>
  <LI><B>Technical Fit</B> - eCos provides source-level
configuration (more than 200 configuration points) to exactly match
application needs and is tightly integrated with the latest version of
GNUPro tools, including highly optimized compilation technology,
multi-threaded debugging, graphical configuration, test suites, etc.
</UL>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="what_source">Do you provide the source code?</A></H4>
<P>
Absolutely. In fact Cygnus wants eCos development to happen as an open
source project, with the cooperation of the development community on
the net. Cygnus has many years of experience in this field through our
work on the gcc and g++ compilers, the gdb debugger, and many other
tools. The same development model has proved an overwhelming success
in many other projects, most famously Linux. 
<P>
<H4><A NAME="what_configurability">What do you mean by configurability?</A></H4>
<P>
Embedded systems have an amazing range of requirements, from 4 bit
controllers up to large radar arrays with a thousand or so top of
the range processors. Even if we limit the eCos target market to
deeply embedded devices and to processors for which a gcc port is
available, it is not possible to write a single system which meets
everybody's requirements. The conventional approach forces application
developers to warp their software so that it works within the
limitations of the operating system. The eCos approach is to provide a
whole range of options and let the developer configure a system that
best matches the needs of the application. Typical configuration
options include the type of scheduler and the number of priority
levels. The current release of the system has over 200 such options,
and plenty more will be added as the system evolves.
<P>
Code and data size are vitally important for many embedded
applications, so configurability must be achieved without adding any
overheads. Some of it can be done at link time, but for maximum
benefit most of it happens at compile time. It is possible for a
configuration option to affect a single line of code, when this is
appropriate. On the other hand a single configuration option might
control the presence or absence of a complete TCP/IP stack. For system
code written in C or C++ the main mechanism that is employed is C
preprocessor #ifdef statements, which will be familiar to most
embedded application developers.
<P>
Using #ifdef statements to provide a small number of configuration
options is of course not very original. The critical problem is that
configuration options are not independent: for example, changing a
kernel option may affect whether or not the C library can provide
thread-safe versions of various routines. The key innovation in eCos
is that that configuration options are treated as data items in their
own right, complete with descriptions of all the dependencies between
the various options. There is a graphical configuration tool which
allows users to conveniently manipulate the various options,
understand the various interactions, and check that the resulting
configuration is actually valid.
<P>
The configuration framework also serves to componentize the system
into different packages. The core system consists of a number of
different such as the kernel, the C library, the maths library, and so
on. It is possible to enable or disable entire packages, as well as to
manipulate configuration options within these packages. It is also
possible to add new packages to the system, for example a TCP/IP
stack. The key point is that these new packages can specify
dependencies on other parts of the system, for example the TCP/IP
stack could specify that it needs per-thread data support. The same
technology that makes configurability work in the core system allows
new packages to be added to the system and readily incorporated into
an application. We expect large numbers of these packages to become
available over time, and already there are software vendors who want
to turn their existing software into eCos packages. We expect that
many contributions from the open source community will take the form
of ports of existing software or of completely new packages.
<P>
The eCos configuration system does not affect how you develop your own
application code. It is not necessary to write your application in any
special language, or to provide lots of configuration options in your
own code, or to use a special development environment. The main output
from the configuration system is a library that gets linked with your
application code in the usual manner.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="what_size">What are the performance figures?</A></H4>
<P>
A side effect of a fully configurable system is that it is just about
impossible to answer questions like &quot;What is the memory footprint
of the kernel?&quot or &quot;What is the interrupt latency?&quot;
These figures depend in large part on the configuration options
selected by the user. For example if a simple application does not the
kernel at all, directly or indirectly, then the kernel package can be
disabled completely and its memory footprint is 0 bytes. This
information is not useful to a different application developer who
needs lots of kernel functionality.
<P>
<A
HREF="docs/guides/user-guides/real-time-characterization.html">Basic
performance information</A> is available as part of the documentation,
including details of how the numbers were arrived at.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="what_mail">Are there any mailing lists?</A></H4>
<P>
Certainly. There are two main mailing lists which anybody can <A
HREF="intouch.html">subscribe</A> to. The ecos-announce mailing
list is a moderated list for major announcements. The ecos-discuss
mailing list is an unmoderated list for general discussion, both
technical and non-technical. All of Cygnus's eCos development team
will read this list and join in the discussions as appropriate.
<P>
If you have a question which you do not want to discuss in a public
forum then there is a separate <A
HREF="mailto:ecos-maintainers@cygnus.com">ecos-maintainers</A> mail
address. All requests sent to this request will be considered
confidential, and nobody outside Cygnus is able to subscribe to this
list.

<h3>What are the licensing terms?</h3>
<h4><A NAME="license_terms">What are the licensing terms?</A></h4>
<P>
eCos is released under a new license, the
<A HREF="license.html">Cygnus eCos Public License</A> or CEPL for
short. You can also read an <A
HREF="http://www.cygnus.com/ecos1.1/ecoslicense.html">annotated
version</A> of the license and the <A
HREF="http://www.cygnus.com/ecos1.1/motiv.html">motivations</A> for
the license.
<P>
<h4><A NAME="license_meaning">OK, but what does this license actually mean?</A></h4>
<P>
You can use eCos to develop products without paying anybody anything,
no matter how many developers are working on the product or how many
units you expect to ship. This applies not only to the core system
itself but also to any changes anybody makes to the core system.
<P>
A key aspect of the eCos public license is that it is intended to
protect the eCos user community as a whole. It should prevent any
company or individual contributing code to the system and then, maybe
after waiting six months or so, claim that all eCos users are now
guilty of copyright or patent infringements and have to pay royalties.
It should also prevent any company from making some small
improvements, calling the result a completely new system, and
releasing this under a new and less generous license.
<P>
The license does impose one obligation on application developers: you
must include a <A HREF="license.html#B">notice</A> with your
product indicating that it makes use of eCos. 
<P>
<h4><A NAME="license_give_source">Do I have to give away the source code of my application?</A></h4>
<P>
No. Your application source code is your own, to do with as you
please. As far as the eCos public license is concerned you are under
no obligation to reveal a single line of your source code to Cygnus or
to anybody else. In fact you do not even have to tell Cygnus about the
existence of your project, although we would love to know about all
the different products that use eCos.
<P>
<h4><A NAME="license_core_changes">What about changes to the core system?</A></h4>
<P>
Yes. If you make a change to the core eCos system then we believe that
the entire user community should have the opportunity to benefit from
that change. This does not necessarily mean that your changes will
become part of the core system, since there are fairly strict criteria
that have to be satisfied before any contribution will be
incorporated. However any such decisions will be made by the eCos
maintainers, not by the person making the changes.
<P>
<h4><A NAME="license_core">What exactly is the core system?</A></h4>
<P>
eCos is designed to be the component framework for the embedded
systems industry. An eCos release consists of a number of different
packages such as the kernel, the C library, a uITRON compatibility
layer, and so on. All the packages that go into such a release and the
associated documentation constitute the core system, and the license
describes this using the term &quot;Original Code&quot;.
<P>
Another way of looking at this is from a purely practical perspective.
At the end of the day building an application involves linking
together some application-specific object files with some libraries.
The current eCos build system will produce a library libtarget.a,
containing all the packages that the user has selected. All the source
code that goes into the building of this library is part of the core
system and is covered by the eCos public license. Anything which goes
into the application-specific object files is not part of the core
system and is not covered by the public license. Note that this is not
a legally binding definition. In particular you cannot get around the
public license simply by copying bits of eCos sources and making them
part of your application code.
<P>
<h4><A NAME="license_packages">What about other packages?</A></h4>
<P>
Typically other packages will end up as other libraries that need to
be linked with the application code. These other packages may be
covered by different licenses, and application developers should make
sure that the requirements for all licenses are satisfied.
<P>
Some companies or organizations may release packages that are not open
source or freely available. Instead the application developer may have
to pay a one-off license fee or quite possibly per-unit royalties if
the application uses such a package. Not only is this perfectly legal,
Cygnus would very much like other companies to make money by providing
such packages.
<P>
Some packages may be released under the eCos public license without
becoming part of the core system. Typically this will happen if the
eCos maintainers believe that they would be unable to maintain such a
package themselves, for example because it relies on special hardware.
<P>
<h4><A NAME="license_new_packages">What if I create a new package?</A></h4>
<P>
There are two possibilities. If the new package is derived in large
part from some existing software then it is likely that there are
existing license restrictions that will apply. For example if you
create a new eCos device driver by copying an existing one and editing
it then this would constitute a modification to existing code and the
eCos public license would apply to the new device driver. If you
create a new device driver from scratch, or more likely by using an
unencumbered skeleton driver, then you can decide for yourself what
license should apply. If you want the package to be freely available
to the entire eCos community then we recommend the eCos public
license, but the choice is yours.
<P>
<h4><A NAME="license_why_new">Why has Cygnus created a new license?</A></h4>
<P>
Balancing the needs and desires of all the companies, organizations,
and individuals involved with eCos is difficult. The most important
requirement is that the freedom of all eCos users is protected: it
must be impossible for anybody, even Cygnus, to impose restrictions on
how the system can be used now or in the future. Some existing
licenses such as the X11 license do not provide this.
<P>
It is also desirable that all enhancements are made available to the
community as a whole, thus improving the system and making it even
more attractive to potential users. Some existing licenses such as the
BSD license do not provide this.
<P>
The Gnu Public License does meet these requirements, but it goes
further: all applications that get linked with GPL'd code are also
covered by the GPL, which means in practice that application
developers have to make the sources available. In the embedded systems
market this requirement is generally considered unacceptable and many
companies refuse to use any GPL'd code as a result. This would reduce
the uptake of eCos, and we want as many people as possible to use the
system. 
<P>
The Netscape Public License came closest to meeting the requirements.
There were some modifications to reflect the needs of embedded system
developers, and the result was the eCos public license.
<P>
<h4><A NAME="license_coverage">Does the license cover situation ...?</A></h4>
Hopefully yes, but there may be situations that we have missed. If you
have any queries about the license and how it applies to your
situation, please contact us. There are both public and private
channels of communication available, depending on your requirements.
We are always interested in suggested improvements to the license that
are compatible with our overall goals.
<P>
<A HREF="#top">Top</A>
<P>

<h3>Contributing</h3>
<P>
<h4><A NAME="contrib_have_to">Do I have to contribute?</A></h4>
<P>
No. We expect that many people will simply want to use the system as
it is (or rather, as it is after they have configured it to meet their
specific needs), without changing the core system itself or adding any
new packages. Such users are under no obligation to contribute.
<P>
<h4><A NAME="contrib_bazaar">Cathedral or bazaar?</A></h4>
<P>
The <A
HREF="http://www.earthspace.net/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar.html"
TARGET="_top">bazaar</A> of course. For the eCos system Cygnus is
committed to an open development model. In addition to the full
releases we will be making regular snapshot releases and provide
anonymous CVS access to the sources. Discussions about the system will
generally be held in an open <A
HREF="intouch.html">ecos-discuss</A> mailing list.
<P>
However it is necessary to apply a caveat to this. Many of Cygnus's
commercial dealings involve confidential information and are covered
by non-disclosure agreements. A potential port to another architecture
would generally be covered by such an agreement, and hence we would
not be able to disclose any details on an open forum.
<P>
<h4><A NAME="contrib_how">How do I contribute?</A></h4>
<P>
There are ways of contributing to eCos development which involve very
little effort. Providing constructive comments on any part of the
system, including the documentation and the web site, helps us to
identify areas which need improvement. Reporting a problem gives us a
chance to fix it, especially if you provide us with a simple test case
and sufficient information to reproduce the problem. Participation in
the discussions in the <A HREF="intouch.html">ecos-discuss</A> mailing
list gives us a better understanding of the user community, and
perhaps some new ideas.
<P>
If you wish to contribute to the actual code there are still different
levels of involvement. You can write a new package. This could be a
HAL package as part of a port of the system to new hardware. It could
be a device driver. It could provide some new functionality such as a
graphics library. It could be a port of some existing software that is
appropriate for embedded systems. You can enhance an existing package,
for example the eCos kernel. If you find a bug in the system then you
can provide a patch that fixes it. You may also find a way to rewrite
some existing code so that it becomes more efficient and/or needs less
memory. You may add new functionality. Contributions to the
documentation and to the test suites are particularly welcome, since
these areas are often overlooked by contributors.
<P>
Small patches can be sent directly to the ecos-discuss mailing list.
For larger patches it is better to send a message to the mailing list
indicating where the patch can be found. An ftp upload area will be
installed on the sourceware server in the near future to facilitate
submission of patches. For non-trivial patches to the core system we
may require a copyright assignment.
<P>
<h4><A NAME="contrib_what">What code contributions would be accepted?</A></h4>
<P>
The most important criterion is that the contribution must enhance the
system. If it meets this fundamental criterion then there is a good
chance that the contribution will be accepted. More specific criteria
include the following:
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>It must not have undesirable effects in terms of code
      size, data size, cpu cycles, or determinism of the system. This
      restriction can be relaxed if the new behaviour can only be
      explicitly enabled by means of one or more configuration
      options.
      <P>
  <LI>It must be portable to all affected platforms. Usually
      this means that for anything except a new HAL package the code
      must be fully portable.
      <P>
  <LI>It should adhere to the project's coding standards. 
      Most importantly the new code should contain
      appropriate assertions and comments.
      <P>
  <LI>Where appropriate (which is nearly always) it should be
      accompanied by appropriate test cases and documentation.
      <P>
  <LI>There must not be any confusion about licensing or ownership.
      This may require a copyright assignment.
</OL>
<P>
A contribution need not meet all these requirements immediately. In
fact it often makes sense to start with a proposal on the <A
HREF="intouch.html">ecos-discuss</A> mailing list, possibly including
an initial patch which is known to be unacceptable, with the
understanding that the contributor will make further changes. If there
are major problems with the proposed contribution then it is better to
detect these early on. If there is existing code elsewhere which does
much the same job then it is good to know about this as well, to avoid
duplication of effort. There may be better and easier ways to tackle
the problem. If you want to discuss a proposal using more private
communication channels rather than a public mailing list then you can
send email directly to <A
HREF="mailto:ecos-maintainers@cygnus.com">ecos-maintainers@cygnus.com</A>.
<P>
<h4><A NAME="contrib_assign">Why do I need to sign a copyright assignment?</A></h4>
<P>
If a contribution involves a significant change to part of the core
system, for example the kernel, then usually we will need a <A
HREF="assign.html">copyright assignment</A> before we can incorporate
the changes into the system. The reason for this is to protect the
community at large. In theory there is no need for copyright
assignments because all changes to code covered by the eCos public
license are also covered by that license. In practice copyright
assignment provides a useful extra level of protection.
<P>
As an example, consider a scenario where a junior programmer makes a
change to the system and releases it without the knowledge or consent
of management. Some time later management finds out about the
contribution, and decides that it should not have happened. The junior
programmer gets severely reprimanded. The company's lawyers now
approach Cygnus and various users of eCos, claiming that the
contribution violated the company's copyright or quite possibly a
patent, and demanding royalties. Until the issue gets resolved there
would be a significant amount of fear, uncertainty, and doubt amongst
the development community. This would be very harmful. The process of
copyright assignment should prevent this and many other scenarios from
ever arising, because it includes having a disclaimer signed by an
officer of the company or a person with the necessary authority.
<P>
We are aware that copyright assignments involve an unpleasant amount
of bureaucracy for many contributors, especially since we have to deal
with the paperwork at the other end. However we believe that the
additional protection offered is necessary for the eCos user community
as a whole. 
<P>
<h4><A NAME="contrib_projects">I want to start work today! What should I work on?</A></h4>
<P>
Our intention is to provide a set of web pages indicating various
projects that people can work on. These pages will include projects
already in progress and projects that have been suggested but that
have not yet started. Typically additions to these projects will be
proposed on the <A HREF="intouch.html">ecos-discuss</A> mailing list,
discussed for a while, and then a summary will be prepared and become
one of these web pages. Until these pages are ready the best place to
start would be the ecos-discuss mailing list itself.
