<h1>eCos 3.0 beta 1 Testing Guidelines</h1>

<hr noshade size=3>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We are looking for as many developers as possible to support the push towards an eCos 3.0 final
release by evaluating the eCos 3.0 beta 1 release. At present, the maintainers are able test on a
small proportion of the total number of supported boards only. We hope that net users will be able
to fill in some of the gaps in our coverage testing. If you are able to spare some time and have hardware
supported by eCos, please consider downloading the beta release and providing feedback. We
have assembled a set of testing guidelines which should help you to assess the state of eCos
on a specific hardware platform. The guidelines will also ensure that feedback is as useful
and consistent as possible.</p>

<h2>eCos testing procedure</h2>

<ol>
<li>Send e-mail to <a href="mailto:ecos-discuss@ecos.sourceware.org">ecos-discuss@ecos.sourceware.org</a>
stating your intention to test the eCos 3.0 beta 1 release. Please also state the host platform
(eg Fedora 9, Windows XP) and the target hardware platform (eg Atmel AT91EB55) you will be using.</li>
<br>
<li>Download and install the eCos 3.0 beta 1 release by following the
<a href="getstart.html">installation instructions</a>. If a pre-built toolchain
is available for your target hardware architecture, please download and use the pre-built
toolchain for all testing. If you will be testing on a Windows host and already have Cygwin
installed, we recommend that you update your Cygwin installation to use the latest stable version
of each package.</li>
<br>
<li>Build the eCos library and tests for your target using the <i>all</i> packages template
and with no other modifications to the eCos configuration.
We would like testers to use the eCos Configuration Tool (configtool) to
do this. However, if you <i>really</i> don't like using graphical tools, we would still value your
testing feedback using the command-line tool (ecosconfig). The <i>all</i> template is
selected in the Configuration Tool by invoking the <i>Templates</i> dialog box from the <i>Build</i> menu.
Users of ecosconfig should specify "all" as the third argument when creating a new
configuration: <tt>ecosconfig&nbsp;new&nbsp;&lt;target&gt;&nbsp;all</tt></li>
<br>
<li>Run a subset of the eCos tests by invoking the <i>Run Tests</i> dialog box from the <i>Tools</i> menu
and selecting the following tests:<br><br>

<ul><tt>
hal/*</tt> (all HAL tests)<tt><br>
kernel/v3_0b1/tests/tm_basic<br>
kernel/v3_0b1/tests/stress_threads<br>
services/memalloc/common/v3_0b1/tests/malloc4<br>
net/common/v3_0b1/tests/multi_lo_select<br>
language/c/libc/*</tt> (one of the libc tests selected at random)<tt><br>
language/c/libm/v3_0b1/tests/*</tt> (one of the libm tests selected at random)<tt><br>
compat/posix/v3_0b1/tests/*</tt> (one of the POSIX tests selected at random)<tt><br>
</tt></ul>
<br>

If any of the above tests do not pass, please cut and paste the test output from the <i>Output</i>
tab of the <i>Run Tests</i> dialog box into a text file.</li>

<br>
<li>Report any test failures or other problems using Bugzilla. Full instructions are provided on our
<a href="problemreport.html">problem reports</a> page. Please ensure that problems are reported
against version "3.0beta1" and mention the host and toolchain which you were using for testing.
</ol>

<h2>RedBoot testing procedure</h2>

<p><b>Warning!</b> Updating RedBoot on an embedded target involves an element of risk. The level
of risk depends on the alternative facilities which are at your disposal to reprogram the ROM should
the update process fail or the new RedBoot image prove to be faulty. If you are not fully aware of
the risk, we recommend that you do <i>not</i> attempt to update RedBoot or otherwise participate in RedBoot
testing. The eCos maintainers cannot be held responsible for boards which are rendered inoperative
by an attempt to update RedBoot.</p>

<ol>
<li>Install the eCos 3.0 beta 1 release, as described in the eCos testing procedure (above).</li>
<br>
<li>Carefully follow the instructions for building and installing RedBoot for your
target hardware provided either in the <a href="docs-latest/redboot/redboot-guide.html">RedBoot User Guide</a>
or in the <a href="docs-latest/ref/ecos-ref.html">eCos Reference</a>.</li>
<br>
<li>Verify that you are able to enter commands at the <tt>RedBoot&gt;</tt> prompt using
both serial and ethernet ports as applicable.</li>
<br>
<li>Verify that you are able to download and execute eCos tests using GDB. Again,
please verify correct operation using both serial and ethernet ports as applicable.</li>
<br>
<li>Report problems using Bugzilla, as described in the eCos testing procedure (above).</li>
</ol>
