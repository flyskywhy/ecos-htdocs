<BR><H2>eCos Copyright Assignment Form</H2>
Revision 1.1
<HR SIZE=3>

<P>This preamble describes how to use the standard eCos copyright assignment
form. The rationale behind this assignment is to avoid any possible confusion
over the legal ownership of eCos, and to indemnify Red Hat and all eCos users
against copyright or patent claims on contributed code used within eCos.
Red Hat would be especially vulnerable, but all users and their eCos based
applications could be affected.<p>

All contributions to eCos for which there are copyright assignments will be
covered by the Red Hat eCos public license. The license provides a guarantee
that the contribution will remain freely available to all.<p>

This agreement gives Red Hat ownership of your changes but promises that you will
retain the right to use your contributed changes as you see fit.<p>

Because employers often can claim ownership over things that employees write,
you may also have to get your employer to sign a disclaimer that says that
they have no claim to the changes you are contributing.<p>

Please read everything, and if you have any questions, email
&lt;ecos-assign@cygnus.com&gt; for help.<p>

Thanks for your contribution to eCos!<p>


The way to assign copyright to Red Hat is to sign an assignment
contract. This is what makes Red Hat the legal copyright holder
so that Red Hat can register the copyright on the new version.<p>

If you are employed as a programmer (even at a university), or have made an
agreement with your employer or school that gives them ownership of the
software you write, then Red Hat needs a signed letter from your employer
disclaiming rights to the contributed software.<p>

The disclaimer should be printed on the company's headed paper, and signed
by an officer of the company, or someone authorized to license the company's
intellectual property. Here is an example of wording that can be used for
this purpose:<p>

<pre>
  &lt;INSERT COMPANY NAME&gt; hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  changes and enhancements made by &lt;INSERT YOUR NAME&gt; to eCos, including any
  future revisions of these changes and enhancements.

  &lt;INSERT COMPANY NAME&gt; affirms that it has no other intellectual property
  interest that would undermine this release, or the use of eCos, and will
  do nothing to undermine it in the future.

  &lt;INSERT SIGNATURE OF OFFICER OF COMPANY&gt;, &lt;INSERT DATE&gt;

  &lt;INSERT PRINTED NAME OF OFFICER OF COMPANY&gt;
  &lt;INSERT TITLE OF OFFICER&gt;
</pre>

If your employer says they do have an intellectual property claim that
could conflict with the use of the program, then please contact Red
Hat to discuss possible next steps.<p>

Below is the usual assignment contract. You need to edit and replace
&lt;INSERT NAME OF CONTRIBUTOR&gt; with your full name. Please print a
copy, sign, date, and mail it to:<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal Department (eCos Assignments)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Hat, Inc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2600 Meridian Parkway<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;NC 27713<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;USA<p>

Don't forget to include the original signed copy of the employer's disclaimer.<p>

Please try to print the whole first page of the form on a single piece of
paper. If it doesn't fit on one printed page, put it on two sides of a single
piece of paper, and attach the second page of the form. Please write the date
using letters rather than numbers to avoid any confusion due to international
day/month ordering conventions.<p>

                                eCos ASSIGNMENT

   For good and valuable consideration, receipt of which I acknowledge, I,
&lt;INSERT NAME OF CONTRIBUTOR&gt;, hereby transfer to Red Hat, Inc.
my entire right, title, and interest (including all rights under
copyright) in my changes and enhancements to eCos, subject to the conditions
below. These changes and enhancements are herein called the "Work". The work
hereby assigned shall also include any future revisions of these changes and
enhancements hereafter made by me.

   Upon thirty days prior written notice, Red Hat agrees to grant me
non-exclusive rights to use the Work (i.e. just my changes and enhancements,
not eCos as a whole) as I see fit; (and Red Hat's rights shall otherwise
continue unchanged).

   I hereby agree that if I have or acquire hereafter any patent or interface
copyright or other intellectual property interest dominating the software
enhanced by the Work (or use of that software), such dominating interest will
not be used to undermine the effect of this assignment, i.e. Red Hat and the
general public will be licensed to use, in that program and its derivative
works, without royalty or limitation, the subject matter of the dominating
interest. This license provision will be binding on my heirs, assignees, or
other successors to the dominating interest, as well as on me.

   I hereby represent and warrant that I am the sole copyright holder for the
Work and that I have the right and power to enter into this contract. I hereby
indemnify and hold harmless Red Hat, its officers, employees, and agents
against any and all claims, actions or damages (including attorney's
reasonable fees) asserted by or paid to any party on account of a breach or
alleged breach of the foregoing warranty. I make no other express or implied
warranty (including without limitation, in this disclaimer of warranty, any
warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE).

Agreed:
