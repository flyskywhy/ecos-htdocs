	</P
><P
>	  There is a rationale for this organization: as indicated,
	  the kernel and the µITRON compatibility subsystem are examples
	  of software packages.  For the first few releases of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
>,
	  all the Cygnus packages will move along in step, i.e.
	  Release 1.1 will feature Version 1.1 of every package, and
	  so forth. But in future, especially when third party
	  packages become available, it is intended that the package
	  be the unit of software distribution, so it will be possible
	  to build a system from a selection of packages with
	  different version numbers, and even differing versioning
	  <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>schemes</I
>.
	</P
><P
>	  Cygnus will be developing tools to manage installation and
	  use of packages in this way.  The current underlying
	  <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> build engine
	  (<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pkgconf</B
>) already supports (but is not
	  limited to) this version scheme: when choosing which
	  packages to enable in a build, if multiple versions are
	  present, the choice of which version to use is offered.
	</P
><P
>	  We realize that many users will have their own source code
	  control control system, version control system or
	  equivalent, and will want to use it with
	  <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> sources.  In that case,
	  since a new release of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> comes
	  with different pathnames for all the source files: a bit of
	  work is necessary to import a new release into your source
	  repository.
	</P
><P
>	  One way of handling the import is to rename all the version
	  parts to some common name, for example "current", and
	  continue to work.  "current" is suggested because pkgconf
	  recognizes it and places it first in any list of versions.
	  Cygnus may provide a tool to help with this, or an option in
	  the install wizard.  Alternatively, in a POSIX shell
	  environment (Linux or CygWin32 on Windows) something like
	  the following should do it (do not use this if you do not
	  understand it):
	</P

><br>
	</P
><P
>	  Having carried out such a renaming operation, your source
	  tree will now look like this:

	  code control system.  When you get a subsequent release of
	  <SPAN

><P
>	  The <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> build tool will now
	  offer only the "current" version of each package; select
	  this for the packages you wish to use.
	</P
><P
>	  Making such a change has implications for any build trees
	  you already have in use.  A configured build tree contains
	  information about the selected packages and their selected
	  versions.  Changing the name of the "versioning" folder in
	  the source tree invalidates this information, and in
	  consequence it also invalidates any local configuration
	  options you have set up in this build tree.  So if you want
	  to change the version information in the source tree, do it
	  first, before investing any serious time in configuring and
	  building your system.  When you create a new build tree to
	  deal with the new source layout, it will contain default
	  settings for all the configuration options, just like an old
	  build tree did before you configured it.  You will need to
	  redo that configuration work in the new tree.
	</P
><P
>	  Moving source code around also invalidates debugging
	  information in any programs or libraries built from the old
	  tree; these will need to be rebuilt in any case.
