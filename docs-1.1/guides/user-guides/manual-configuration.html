	system and building the target library. At present there is no
	equivalent to this tool available for developers using a UNIX
	host, so command line tools have to be used instead. These
	command line tools can also be used for batch operations on
	all platforms, for example as part of a nightly rebuild
	procedure.
    </P
><P
>	In the current release of the system the command line tools do
	not provide exactly the same functionality as the graphical
	tool. Most importantly, there are no automatic checks that all
	the dependencies between the various configuration options are
	actually satisfied.</P
><P
>	For example, in the C library package there is a configuration
	option that determines whether or not the library provides
	thread-safe implementations of the
	<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
><B
>strtok()</B
></TT
> function. This option depends on
	functionality that the kernel may or may not provide.</P
><P
>	With command line tools, it is possible to disable this option 
	in the kernel, meaning that the C library's dependencies are no
	longer satisfied. The graphical configuration tool will detect
	this situation immediately and advise you that remedial
	action is needed, but when using command line tools most of these
	dependencies will be checked at compile-time, resulting in
	build failures; it is not possible to check every dependency.
    </P
><P
>	The <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> configuration system, both graphical and command
	line tools, are under constant development and
	enhancement. Developers should note that the procedures
	described may change considerably in future releases.

></H1
><P
>	  When building <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> there are three main directory trees to
	  consider: the source tree, the build tree, and the install
	  tree.</P
><P
>	  The source tree, also known as the component repository, is
	  read-only. It is possible to use a single component
	  repository for any number of different configurations, and
	  it is also possible to share a component repository between
	  multiple users by putting it on a network drive.
	</P
><P
>	  The build tree contains everything that is specific to a 
	  particular configuration, including header and other files 
	  that contain configuration data, and the object files that 
	  result from compiling the system sources for this 
	  configuration.
	</P
><P
>	  The install tree is usually located in the
	  <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>install</TT
> subdirectory of the build
	  tree. Once an <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> system has  been built, the install
	  tree contains all the files needed for application
	  development including the header files and the target
	  library. By making copies of the install tree after a build
	  it is possible to separate application development and
	  system configuration, which may be desirable for some
	  organizations.
