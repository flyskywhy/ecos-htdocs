>	  A number of factors can affect real-time performance in a
	  system.  One of the most common factors, yet most difficult
	  to characterize, is the effect of device drivers and
	  interrupts on system timings.  Different device drivers will
	  have differing requirements as to how long interrupts are
	  suppressed, for example.  The <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> system has been designed with
	  this in mind by separating the management of interrupts (ISR
	  handlers) and the processing required by the interrupt (DSR
	  handlers). However, since there is so much variability here,
	  and indeed most device drivers will come from the end users
	  themselves, these effects cannot be reliably measured.  We have
	  attempted to measure the overhead of the single interrupt
	  that <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> relies on, the real-time clock timer.  This
	  should give the user a reasonable idea of the cost of
	  executing interrupt handling for devices.
