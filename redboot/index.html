    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>
      RedBoot, the <b>R</b>ed Hat <b>E</b>mbedded <b>D</b>ebug
      and <b>Boot</b>strap firmware, is a complete bootstrap environment
      for embedded systems. Based on Red Hat's <a href="/ecos/">eCos RTOS</a>
      Hardware Abstraction Layer, RedBoot inherits eCos' qualities of
      reliability, compactness, configurability, and portability. 
    </p>
    <p>
      RedBoot allows download and execution of embedded applications
      via serial or ethernet, including embedded Linux and eCos applications.
      It can be used for both product development (debug support) and
      in deplayed products in the field (Flash update and network
      booting).
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethernet download and debug support is included, allowing
      RedBoot to retrieve its IP parameters via BOOTP or DHCP, and
      program images to be downloaded using TFTP. Images can also be
      downloaded over serial, using X- or Y-modem.
    </p>
    <p>
      RedBoot can be used to communicate with GDB (the GNU Debugger)
      to debug applications via serial or ethernet, including the
      ability to interrupt a running application started by GDB.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interactive command-line interface is provided to allow management
      of the Flash images, image download, RedBoot configuration, etc.,
      accessible via serial or ethernet. For unattended or automated
      startup, boot scripts can be stored in Flash allowing for example
      loading of images from Flash or a TFTP server.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an open source company, Red Hat has made all sources and
      documentation for RedBoot, and the eCos operating system on which it
      is based, freely available without license or royalties.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more details about the RedBoot product, please visit the
      <a href="http://www.redhat.com/embedded/technologies/redboot/"
         target="_top"> RedBoot product site</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Hardware support and RedBoot binaries</h2>
    <p>
      As RedBoot is based on the <a href="/ecos/" target="_top">eCos
      operating system</a>, it is easy to port RedBoot to any system
      to which eCos has been ported.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full details of <a href="/ecos/hardware.html">supported hardware are
      available</a>, including whether RedBoot is supported. Red Hat has
      also made available RedBoot binaries for all publically supported
      platforms and these can be found in the detailed information page
      for each board.
    </p>
    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>
      The RedBoot User's Guide is available on-line in both
      <a href="/ecos/docs-latest/redboot/redboot.html">HTML</a>
      and <a href="/ecos/docs-latest/redboot/redboot.pdf">PDF</a>
      formats. Installation instructions for each board are provided
      in the User's Guide.
    </p>
    <h2>Getting the source</h2>
    <p>
      Red Hat is a passionate advocate of open source and has made all
      sources to RedBoot available under the
      <a href="/ecos/license.html">Red Hat eCos Public License</a>. As
      a result, all users have already been able to benefit from the
      developer community's efforts to enhance and maintain RedBoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      All sources are available from the <a href="/ecos/anoncvs.html">
      eCos anonymous CVS repository</a>. Windows users should ensure
      they have a recent version of the
      <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_top">Cygwin tools</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Contacting Red Hat</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="/ecos/intouch.html">Mailing lists for RedBoot and eCos</a>
      are available if you wish to receive announcements about RedBoot or
      eCos, or to participate with the developer's community in technical
      discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Red Hat are also pleased to offer a range of engineering services
      including porting, enhancements, consultancy and world-class
      commercial grade support in all areas to do with RedBoot and eCos.
