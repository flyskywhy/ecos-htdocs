    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
      RedBoot is a complete bootstrap environment
      for embedded systems. Based on the <a href="/ecos/">eCos</a>
      Hardware Abstraction Layer, RedBoot inherits the eCos qualities of
      reliability, compactness, configurability, and portability.
    </p>
    <p>
      RedBoot allows download and execution of embedded applications
      via serial or ethernet, including embedded Linux and eCos applications.
      It can be used for both product development (debug support) and
      in deplayed products in the field (Flash update and network
      booting).
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethernet download and debug support is included, allowing
      RedBoot to retrieve its IP parameters via BOOTP or DHCP, and
      program images to be downloaded using TFTP. Images can also be
      downloaded over serial, using X- or Y-modem.
    </p>
    <p>
      RedBoot can be used to communicate with GDB (the GNU Debugger)
      to debug applications via serial or ethernet, including the
      ability to interrupt a running application started by GDB.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interactive command-line interface is provided to allow management
      of the Flash images, image download, RedBoot configuration, etc.,
      accessible via serial or ethernet. For unattended or automated
      startup, boot scripts can be stored in Flash allowing for example
      loading of images from Flash or a TFTP server.
    </p>
    <h2>Hardware support and RedBoot binaries</h2>
    <p>
      As RedBoot is based on the <a href="/ecos/" target="_top">eCos
      operating system</a>, it is easy to port RedBoot to any system
      to which eCos has been ported.
    </p>
    <p>
      A full list of eCos <a href="/ecos/hardware.html">supported hardware</a> is
      available, including details of RedBoot support.
      <a href="/ecos/boards/redbootbins/">Prebuilt RedBoot binaries</a> are
      also available for all publically supported platforms. These can
      be found, along with platform specific documentation,
      from the <i>More Info</i> link for each board in the
      list of <a href="/ecos/hardware.html">supported hardware</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>
      The RedBoot User's Guide is available on-line in both
      <a href="/ecos/docs-latest/redboot/redboot.html">HTML</a>
      and <a href="/ecos/docs-latest/redboot/redboot.pdf">PDF</a>
      formats. Installation instructions for each board are provided
      in the User's Guide.
    </p>
    <h2>Getting the source</h2>
    <p>
      All the
      source code of RedBoot is available under the
      <a href="/ecos/license-overview.html">eCos License</a>. As
      a result, all users are able to benefit from the
      efforts of the developer community to enhance and maintain RedBoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      All sources are available from the <a href="/ecos/anoncvs.html">
      eCos anonymous CVS repository</a>. Windows users should ensure
      they have a recent version of the
      <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_top">Cygwin tools</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Mailing lists</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="/ecos/intouch.html">Mailing lists for RedBoot and eCos</a>
      are available if you wish to receive announcements about RedBoot or
      eCos, or to participate with the developer community in technical
      discussion.
