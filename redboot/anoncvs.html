<h1>Anonymous CVS Access</h1>
<HR noshade SIZE=3>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The most recent versions of RedBoot may be obtained using anonymous CVS
access. 
This facility provides immediate access to the <a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/ecos/packages/NEWS?content-type=text/plain&cvsroot=ecos">latest RedBoot
features</a> and the rapid deployment of any necessary bug fixes.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with CVS, the following resources may be of use:
<UL>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/" target="_top">CVShome.org</A> has CVS
    clients available for download. Other information and links to books
    on the subject can also be found at this site.
  </li>
  <LI>
    A good starting point is the
    <A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/blandy.html" target="_top">
    Introduction to CVS</A> by Jim Blandy.
  </li>
  <LI>
    The CVS sources come with <i>texinfo</i> documentation which is also
    available in <A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_toc.html"
    target="_top"> HTML format</A>.
  </li>
</UL>
We also provide a simple but effective way to
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/?cvsroot=ecos">view the eCos and RedBoot CVS
repository</a>
over the web using CVSweb. You can inspect the contents, history and
differences between versions of all files in the repository in this way.</p>

<h2>The RedBoot repository</h2>

<p>The CVS source repository used is the same as the <a href="/ecos/">eCos
</a> <a href="/ecos/anoncvs.html">anonymous CVS repository</a>. This
is because RedBoot is based on eCos. For that reason, if you already have
an existing checked out eCos source tree, you do not need to check out RedBoot
sources separately.
The RedBoot (and eCos) anonymous CVS repository contains the latest version
of our master
internal repository and is generally updated on a weekly basis. However,
users should note that these updates have not been rigorously tested and
cannot be guaranteed to build or function correctly. <!-- It is therefore
recommended that new developers work with the latest full release of eCos
which has been put through extensive testing and QA. --> If you have a
stable and tested release for your platform available to you, in general
that should be used in preference. The repository should be
used in situations where you need access to new features, bug fixes, or are
working on a shared contributed project.</p>

<p>The snapshots include as much source code as we are able to
publicize. However, there may be new architectural ports,
board ports, or areas of functionality which are not released for commercial
or contractual reasons.</p>

<p>The relevant host side build tools may be obtained by FTP from this site and are not provided by anonymous CVS.
Any patches or changes required to enable the use of these tools
with the latest version of eCos in the repository will be publicized.
If any updates to the eCos Configuration Tool are required, we
will put up a new binary as soon as possible. You should ensure that you use the latest version of
the eCos Configuration Tools which may be downloaded below when
working with the sources from the anonymous CVS repository.</p>

<h2>Accessing the repository</h2>

<p>Before you can access the CVS repository, you must have a CVS client (see
above) and direct TCP/IP access. If you are behind a firewall, you should
discuss access with your local systems administrator.</p>

<p>Type the following command to login to the CVS server:</p>
<kbd>cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@sources.redhat.com:/cvs/ecos login</kbd>

<p>You will be prompted for a password which is <i>anoncvs</i>. You only need to
perform this login the first time you access the eCos/RedBoot CVS repository.
The password is saved in the file <tt>.cvspass</tt> in your home
directory for use in subsequent sessions.</p>

<p>If you have an existing eCos installation, it is recommended that you
use different directory trees for the anonymous CVS sources and for
full releases of eCos. </p>

<p>To check out a complete set of sources for <i>all</i> targets, Create a new
directory for the check out, change to that directory, and type:</p>

<kbd>cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@sources.redhat.com:/cvs/ecos -z 9 co -P redboot-all</kbd>

<p>This command should initiate a connection to the CVS server and check out
the latest version of RedBoot. In the future, when you want to update your
repository to the latest version, go to this same directory, and
repeat the above command.</p>

<p>Users who have used cvs before may be tempted to perform a
<tt>cvs update -d</tt> operation, however if this is used at the top level,
this will check out a full eCos source repository, containing many more files
than are required to build just RedBoot.</p>

<p>

<h2>Downloading sources for particular targets</h2>

<p>When executing the above command, the checked out sources include
all ports and device drivers, including even those on which RedBoot is
not supported (but which are supported by eCos). For some targets, we are
available to provide special modules which contain only the sources required
to build RedBoot on that target.</p>

<p>At this time, the only target supported with this mechanism is the ipaq.
To check out ipaq-only RedBoot sources, use the checkout command as above,
but replace <i>redboot-all</i> with <i>redboot-ipaq</i>.</p>

<p>

<h2>Using the repository</h2>

<p>Once the sources have been checked out, Unix users (or Windows users using
the command line) can switch to it by setting the <tt>ECOS_REPOSITORY</tt>
environment variable to the <tt>ecos/packages</tt> subdirectory of the
checked out tree. For example:</p>

<nobr>
<kbd>ECOS_REPOSITORY=/ecoscvs/ecos/packages ; export ECOS_REPOSITORY</kbd> (for <i>sh</i>, <i>ksh</i> and <i>bash</i> users)<br>
<kbd>setenv ECOS_REPOSITORY /ecoscvs/ecos/packages</kbd> (for <i>csh</i> and <i>tcsh</i> users)
</nobr>

<p>Users of the eCos Configuration Tool should select the new repository using
the Build->Repository menu item.</p>

<p>Use of a new repository with an old build tree is not recommended. Changes
may have been made to the repository CDL files that will not be present in
the working versions in your build tree.</p>

<A name="host-tools"></a><h2>Host configuration tools</h2>

<p>The current set of sources in the CVS repository require an updated version
of the host-side configuration tools. You may wish to recompile these
yourself using the host tool sources available from anonymous CVS.
Alternatively, unsupported prebuilt binaries are available for Windows
and Red Hat Linux 6.x hosts.</p>

<h3>Updated configuration tools for Windows</h3>

<p>Self-extracting zip files for updated binaries of both the
<A HREF="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/anoncvs/Configtool1312.exe">
eCos Configuration Tool for Windows</A> and the
<A HREF="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/anoncvs/ecosconfig1314.exe">
command-line <tt>ecosconfig</tt> tool</A> are available.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you rename the existing files <tt>Configtool.exe</tt>
and <tt>ecosconfig.exe</tt> to <tt>Configtool.exe.old</tt> and
<tt>ecosconfig.exe.old</tt> before proceeding. These files are found in
the <tt>tools/bin</tt> subdirectory of your eCos installation.</p>

<p>Install the revised configuration tools by executing the downloaded files.
Modify the suggested target folder as necessary to place the extracted files
in the <CODE>tools/bin</CODE> directory of your eCos installation.</p>

<p>To update the platforms list for the "Run Tests" feature, you will need
to download and run 
<A HREF="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/anoncvs/eCos1312.reg">this
registry fragment</a>. Once downloaded, simply double click the file to install
it.</p>

<p>Note that using the updated Configuration Tool with an eCos v1.3.1
repository will lead to problems if the memory layout is modified.</p>

<h3>Updated configuration tools for Red Hat Linux 6.x and 7</h3>

<p>An unsupported prebuilt binary of the updated <tt>ecosconfig</tt> tool for
Red Hat Linux 6.x and above is
<A HREF="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/ecos/anoncvs/ecosconfig1314-linux.gz">
available for download</a>.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you rename the existing <tt>ecosconfig</tt>
executable to <tt>ecosconfig.old</tt> before proceeding. This file is
located in the <tt>tools/bin</tt> subdirectory of your eCos installation.</p>

<p>Uncompress the updated tool with the commands:</p>
<kbd>
gzip -N -d ecosconfig1314-linux.gz<br>
chmod +x ecosconfig
</kbd>

<p>Move the resulting <tt>ecosconfig</tt> executable into the <tt>tools/bin</tt>
subdirectory of your eCos installation.</p>

<h2>Other notes</h2>

<p>Anonymous CVS access to the repository is read-only. If
you would like to contribute a change, bug fix or other improvement
to eCos then you should start by discussing it on the 
<A HREF="/ecos/intouch.html">
ecos-discuss</A> mailing list. If applicable, you may wish to post
(or put up for FTP) the relevant diff or patch.</p>

<p>You can obtain e-mail notifications when changes are made to the eCos
repository. Refer to our <A HREF="/ecos/intouch.html">keeping in touch</a>
page for further details.</p>

<p>Since the anonymous CVS repository is copied from the master
repository, the author field and log entries are not accurate.
Use the ChangeLog files at the top of each package
hierarchy to obtain history on the sources in that package.</p>

<p>David Airlie of Parthus Technologies plc. has <A
HREF="../ml/ecos-discuss/2000-07/msg00070.html">announced</A> the
availability of FTP snapshots of the complete eCos and RedBoot repository.
It is possible to obtain <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.skynet.ie/cvs/" target="_top">complete snaphosts</A> and <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.skynet.ie/cvs/ecos/" target="_top">individual files</A>. This
service may be particularly useful for people unable to run CVS
directly, for example because of corporate firewalls.</p>

<!--
<a href="docs-latest/">Updated documentation</a> is available, covering
changes to eCos since the last official public release. Users of the
anonymous CVS sources should refer to the updated documentation.
-->

<p>Queries and problems regarding use of the anonymous CVS service should
be directed to the <A HREF="/ecos/intouch.html">
ecos-discuss</A> mailing list. The eCos development team,
including the anonymous CVS maintainer, read this list. Please clarify
that the mail concerns an anonymous CVS problem in the subject field.</p>
